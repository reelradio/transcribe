It is but after that she never touched yeah we're both very proud of that I haven't smoked in guys 10 years I quit the day after the another day with two weeks after the announcement came out back in 64 or 17 years and I was a 4-day of the four for four pack a day guy and I would stay up late at night till 2 in the morning just so I can smokeafter the announcement and it was a gray hair doctor from down in Florida and had the white Smock on and everything and said if you don't have lung cancer now consider yourself in good shape and she stopped smoking today you won't get it I can wipe the Slate clean stopped right then and there never had another cigarette except when I did a couple of movies where I pretend to smoke but then I must stand as smoking I'm just because I had a friend recently to have a smoke doing okay it's been at least 7 or 15 years and Iit was an accident almost who all God has wanted it had to be right then so so it was still with Dad about a half is if is one a week or once a day so I was writing for a house spa for my newspaper town and I was invited up to some house but I do like a fasting spot and I went up there and he said he can't have any sides that made City nicotine any caffeine in this cigarette that I saw my arm was like yeah I do you know where whereI still have the rash in my skin looking young and I'm thinking I don't wanna do this anymore and it really once I stood for the four days it was and I never want to smoke most people can't smoke can't stop I'm not stopping thank God but Gandhi once said the only way you can break a bad habit is if the bad habit is standing in the way of something you want more now I quit in the way of something you want more than you wanted more to be healthy than to smoke obviously when I saw that the Hollywood and once I got here I figured I am I going to kill myself commits suicide after working so hard to get where I really wanted to be so I stopped because I want to be alive to enjoy any success that I might have and so that was youwe obviously had to be successful somewhere to get up there I heard it's beautiful and I started out as an actor on The Lone Ranger show on the radio show in Sergeant Preston of the characters from 12 years old people to take people out here that really have no idea what radio are acting was and you did radioactive do you want any of the toy that was within two or three other shows as well as the Green Hornet Bob Barclay American historyradio radio is is the best medium for using your imagination and which radio you can create million-dollar set billion dollars find finger Martin and that's why radio so wonderful because I probably picked up from being on on radio is an actor picked up the idea that you can tell a great story on radio & Paint any picture you want to paint and so that's what I do on my radio show with doing human interest stories and so on and of course I also read the request and dedication so often called the long-distance dedication and that too is it something that each person can imagine in his or her mind and if you could you would you would say that I feel the same way with with what I write because I thought it was something I say that's like painting a picture with words so it's the same that you was going to say the words and you try to make a picture in them you have a conversation when I write something the same thing as like drawing a picture you want and you can create anything you want to create doing something Noble about to do another one in person there's only one Jerry Lewis I need my medicine at the 2:38 on the other one but and 12 of those nationally with Jerry the last couple of years old nationally and locally hosting it with my wife and karoly KTLA anchor people and their wonderful to work with a J and Carl they said that they wanted me to put Casey's credits as and they said Put it is jeans husband's you know so if I can get your own identity I guess eventually but but you got a little baby named Liberty birthday on May 31st and she was born on on July 4th they said 5 in the morning on July 4th July 4th or Justice if it's a boy Shoji degrees is at least we didn't know whether it's a boy or girl but she became Liberty image of the hospital he had a name that's in the Lana and I had three children under three I had newborn one and a half in Two and a Half I didn't want to go home so I can make it for you have you take her home is go baby tiger as they why not you either had a lot of other causes I can receive it quote is one thing about nuclear March 3rd in Soviet Union in 1987 are they were Soviet citizens that American citizens in from other countries as well and it was too March against an arms race nobody want and then before that I've participated with the folks who marched all the way across the United States from Los Angeles to Washington DC in about 9 months so I set up for different fundraisers on the radio along the way the children of Chernobyl right off of red square and the animals were one of the groups from from England that came over and I co-hosted it with the a newsman a Russian use man who'd grown up in the United States if you know this but I am I spent quite a bit of time in Israel and Israel they have a I believe it's like a bad group area there was a date Hasbro very many children from turnerville really bad case you are and how they taking them and they raise them and you know protect them and they're back and it's really scary like a pic of the KGB for smuggling a prayer books then is that a friend I really wish the second time I went we we could see the Americans can see that things were changing under Gorbachev they were really changing and when I tried to tell that to people back here or not it's nothing good things are really changing we all felt it because if we could talk to people about politics and nobody was going to put them in the bag 76 if you tried to talk like that you had to be worried if I could really yeah they were they were watching you everywhere and I would have sent a guy was there and they had the bugs in the synagogue and it is really very dangerous then so you were there to promote 10 years later you know what also different people and they admitted it they weren't afraid to say things politically that I thought would have got them thrown in jail changing LED how is right in your area every year you know we were both we both Believers in the end and World Peace guy knows we ever get it but it's it's it's within our reach anyhow you what it was that was starting to 70 series it was something that you were that you're famous quote was the hell else about Michael Jackson you were can I see Michael Jackson I have a nice to have the think the other two Michael Jackson the singer is no longer Michael Jackson he's really he's Diana Ross and drag now I met him and talk to him when we had lunch together with several other people that's what I think a couple of years ago very shy didn't have a lot to say talk about vegetarianism and he said he had to really get off of he was a vegan and that's what I am a vegan is someone who doesn't eat fish meat fish poultry or dairy product either a traitor to the vegan I had to go back to having cheese and eggs because of my weight loss was just enormous and when you become a vegetarian you it's very easy to maintain your your weight things that are rich in calories if it's all right if they go together I agree I think starting with him out with the nonviolent music to though yes we do this is actually this is my anniversary this year we've been 25 years so you and your body will respect you for your wisdom the animals will love you for your compassion and strokes you at their folks you keep coming back in to watch me because you made no because you made love is see me never hate us cuz you're terrific and you just keep coming in and watch out World here comes early");
