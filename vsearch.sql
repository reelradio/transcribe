It is but after that she never touched yeah we're both very proud of that I haven't smoked in guys 10 years I quit the day after the another day with two weeks after the announcement came out back in 64 or 17 years and I was a 4-day of the four for four pack a day guy and I would stay up late at night till 2 in the morning just so I can smokeafter the announcement and it was a gray hair doctor from down in Florida and had the white Smock on and everything and said if you don't have lung cancer now consider yourself in good shape and she stopped smoking today you won't get it I can wipe the Slate clean stopped right then and there never had another cigarette except when I did a couple of movies where I pretend to smoke but then I must stand as smoking I'm just because I had a friend recently to have a smoke doing okay it's been at least 7 or 15 years and Iit was an accident almost who all God has wanted it had to be right then so so it was still with Dad about a half is if is one a week or once a day so I was writing for a house spa for my newspaper town and I was invited up to some house but I do like a fasting spot and I went up there and he said he can't have any sides that made City nicotine any caffeine in this cigarette that I saw my arm was like yeah I do you know where whereI still have the rash in my skin looking young and I'm thinking I don't wanna do this anymore and it really once I stood for the four days it was and I never want to smoke most people can't smoke can't stop I'm not stopping thank God but Gandhi once said the only way you can break a bad habit is if the bad habit is standing in the way of something you want more now I quit in the way of something you want more than you wanted more to be healthy than to smoke obviously when I saw that the Hollywood and once I got here I figured I am I going to kill myself commits suicide after working so hard to get where I really wanted to be so I stopped because I want to be alive to enjoy any success that I might have and so that was youwe obviously had to be successful somewhere to get up there I heard it's beautiful and I started out as an actor on The Lone Ranger show on the radio show in Sergeant Preston of the characters from 12 years old people to take people out here that really have no idea what radio are acting was and you did radioactive do you want any of the toy that was within two or three other shows as well as the Green Hornet Bob Barclay American historyradio radio is is the best medium for using your imagination and which radio you can create million-dollar set billion dollars find finger Martin and that's why radio so wonderful because I probably picked up from being on on radio is an actor picked up the idea that you can tell a great story on radio & Paint any picture you want to paint and so that's what I do on my radio show with doing human interest stories and so on and of course I also read the request and dedication so often called the long-distance dedication and that too is it something that each person can imagine in his or her mind and if you could you would you would say that I feel the same way with with what I write because I thought it was something I say that's like painting a picture with words so it's the same that you was going to say the words and you try to make a picture in them you have a conversation when I write something the same thing as like drawing a picture you want and you can create anything you want to create doing something Noble about to do another one in person there's only one Jerry Lewis I need

3rd in Soviet Union in 1987 are they were Soviet citizens that American citizens in from other countries as well and it was too March against an arms race nobody want and then before that I've participated with the folks who marched all the way across the United States from Los Angeles to Washington DC in about 9 months so I set up for different fundraisers on the radio along the way the children of Chernobyl right off of red square and the animals were one of the groups from from England that came over and I co-hosted it with the a newsman a Russian use man who'd grown up in the United States if you know this but I am I spent quite a bit of time in Israel and Israel they have a I believe it's like a bad group area there was a date Hasbro very many children from turnerville really bad case you are and how they taking them and they raise them and you know protect them and they're back and it's really scary like a pic of the KGB for smuggling a prayer books then is that a friend I really wish the second time I went we we could see the Americans can see that things were changing under Gorbachev they were really changing and when I tried to tell that to people back here or not it's nothing good things are really changing we all felt it because if we could talk to people about politics and nobody was going to put them in the bag 76 if you tried to talk like that you had to be worried if I could really yeah they were they were watching you everywhere and I would have sent a guy was there and they had the bugs in the synagogue and it is really very dangerous then so you were there to promote 10 years later you know what also different people and they admitted it they weren't afraid to say things politically that I thought would have got them thrown in jail

other two Michael Jackson the singer is no longer Michael Jackson he's really he's Diana Ross and drag now I met him and talk to him when we had lunch together with several other people that's what I think a couple of years ago very shy didn't have a lot to say talk about vegetarianism and he said he had to really get off of he was a vegan and that's what I am a vegan is someone who doesn't eat fish meat fish poultry or dairy product either a traitor to the vegan I had to go back to having cheese and eggs because of my weight loss was just enormous and when you become a vegetarian you it's very easy to maintain your your weight things that are rich in calories if it's all right if they go together I agree I think starting with him out with the nonviolent music to though yes we do this

Working in Winston-Salem North Carolina and I don't recall now how I heard of him whether he contacted Maggie or somebody told me about him a while back and he was doing old-fashioned radio but I heard that voice is unlocked and talk to it and we would talk for hours at a time and I am trying to determine whether or not he would do or could do what I wanted him to do and that was simply to continue to tell the story but he told but I wanted him not to do it 5 or 10 minutes at a time if you do it 30 seconds at a time before I hired him I took the tables are already gutteridge who was our general manager and quite a guy and he took the tape home and in the radio station you didn't hear the magic I don't think he took the Payphone he listened to it while he was having breakfast he said he listened to it while they brushing his teeth and shaving and while it was shaving it hitting and he came back into jail let's do it so we hired Bailey loaning money to get to Lewisville paid him a hundred and sixty-five bucks the way Kenny's Cry-Baby arrived in town they stayed with me for a while till he got a little fleabag of an apartment someplace I found that fan still a door when I arrived this morning if that's good morning Phil Bailey house the dope this morning please say hello to the school cafeteria play something by Bobby Goldsboro for them after 7:30 please 7:39 then do the sign fell Evans and Jim are red white and blue postal Department representatives from the Starks building house about that the agreed that he would start one of these rambling Yarns and then he would talk to about 30 to 40 seconds and no matter where he was or what he was doing and play the next commercial or whatever was coming up where was only a jump back and pick up the story as if nothing had happened at first it was over rugged but got the hang of it but some were convinced wauk LOL let me tell you that is probably coming at you with anything else we listen to as we saw the numbers again first week he works there he came in and quit 5 and during that period of time I think about every disc jockey there came in and threatened to quit Johnny Randolph still Chris Paul the fellows were calling and Mitch's body after a while they sort of worked out he caught on a calm down you relaxed they began to accept him I laughed because it was a drinking problem ever ever so far next door to the station called cabs in about a year after Bailey started they used to slip him out the back of the bar in the afternoon while I was in the year to keep me from seeing and staggered if they knew I could only stays the same guys who were threatening to quit the first week in protecting it they work there any would do in the morning to go before bill was and Bill and firstly everybody else in the radio station was just outraged Glenville daily with her it was like what are they thinking it is terrible you'll never amount to anything and I know you'd betray Bill Chris Baba blah blah blah so bill came into a freak negative environment and terms of employees including me I mean it's not real happy about him being married right away they want into it but after I did it weigh my soul told me that I should do it they don't seem to be very appreciative of it especially Terrell must be nice. There is a great guy for John Laurens and 5 got a petition to get me house they wanted me out of there but I came in at number one already so she had to drop it remaining 1080 Keller Circle they won't be forgetting the magic made wacky years later he was the guy who made it all happen and he drank too much he would go into a bar in the evening and he was saved by a tender my friends and he would not have enough money to pay the bar tab I got a call and save him out of jail or his wife would call me at 4:35 in the morning and say Bailey has a toothache read sicari as bad and he finally we began to Ernie gutteridge general manager was a brilliant man still is we got together and decided to just control Bailey so I remember give me into the office one day complimenting him and I kept pulling unit closer and closer bailed you are the best disc jockey in town no no no no no no no no no forget that you are the best folding disc jockey in the United States know Bailey actually you're the best in the whole world that supposed to mean going to slam my hand out of my desk and I said but you're not worth a damn when you're not here and if you are a late again I'm going to fire you and run you out of town on the other hand Bill if you will be good be here on time and not make it to come and do your show in the morning to do it from now until whatever the date was like 3 months later we have to have tickets at such-and-such hotel in Cincinnati we have tickets to the Coney Island such-and-such a concert and you're going to go over there and have this wonderful week and with you and in The Duchess and the Duke list all on the company while he was as good as gold for those 90 days we sent him home for the weekend and some dinner at about every 90 days 5 months we were sitting someplace if you've been good and you stay good then we took over you got paid and the paycheck was immediately endorsed over to the bookkeeper who paid his rent car payment is everything and then we gave him any money and that way we kept them under control. He was a model citizen wklo general manager Randy Goodrich Brown apparel and a lot of patience and understanding from the staff Billy emerged as the dominant morning broadcaster in Lewisville underneath that blustering humor and sometimes incisive on the air remarks about management in general was a man who thought they needed reassurance not too unusual we all do but with Bill it took a dramatic turn every 3 or 4 months he would resign his request was respect and after discussion I would ask him to think it over and then I would contact the Kentucky State Park system and find a state park that could accommodate bill and his family for a few days broken going to take a long weekend and come in and see me when you got back to see me you just went back on the Arizona thing can happen little visited several state parks as a guest of wklo buddy here and her husband all of us went out to Shakey's wasn't we went out to Shakey's for a little song fast. Then I never had such a good time with my life boy we sang songs like went home about 2 a.m. Blink 182 lunch today and I know why he wants to borrow some money and I mean that sincerely if you have never tasted collard greens and backbone you don't know what life is all about I'll tell you one thing you eat a good mess of greens and butter beans and and I'll tell you once once again Alan Bryant remember why you started working mornings I've been working afternoon and I started talking to each other on the air which he had not been doing before this eventually turned out to be the bill daily stick them in heating plant a business with the radiator for years up the wacky can I do it here and I have two years at a low before you left to go to hell up it was everything good we started talkin talk to you on the intercom because we were sitting right you know so few feet from each other as we were observing things are we going by on the street and I hear thumping radio and dementia to MRI to ask you a question about something in her how is it interacted with him all the time off the year one day after the new skin when it's supposed to be out here is still daily with more hit PC get the record and go you know he said and I could yeah and he starts talking to me about something or locator see where this goes. Next thing you know this is like a regular occurrence where is coming out of every newscast we're talkin about something and he would occasionally talk to me about things during the go and it just got to be almost like a two-man show after while it was really a fund it made morning is a lot more interesting for me because the morning new shift was at Surly dulled to work because nothing new ever happened it was all yesterday's news and you just doing a newscast every and the 3:35. We had a great time and I think part of that and I'm sure you did the same thing as like he is kind of like the typical straight man being a band of Johnny Carson type of thing isn't eating them things to work off of and react to sew my sensitivity was always is there something interesting that I've become aware of that he can play with most of those were things I told him off here to begin with but it was a great time I mean you was there really a natural performer and I mean I don't think he ever prepared for a show I don't think they'll ever sit down and said okay what am I going to do today if you just sat down at the microphone turned it on and let it roll Jodeci I wonder if I mess with the audience would you mind getting some of that material to my face haven't made a caustic comments 2 months 3 audience what you just told me about them pushing the buttons here in louiville I don't remember that way you know if you get up there in a big city of Chicago and you work hard and save your money but those pennies away boy than two or three years you'll be able to afford to buy yourself a taxi cab in New York City what's the difference in car dealers and held the title to Duke of oil originate he's a great guy and probably the best together a long time, this modeling business from me and I'll try to get him to come to Louisville he was the Duke I mean that was it was fun to listen to him every morning especially early because you never knew what it was going to say you always told stories about worry Phil the night before and I don't know how much of it was true and how much of it was probably got it sure was fun to listen to it really was a big problem for us cuz you know we had to play the morning man that could be filled daily please turn the station around I think it's March of 69 with the battle of the Giants which is an old my Joseph formatting that he's used a teener the battle of the Giants huge promotion and return the station around immediately but we couldn't crack the morning I mean operating came out in April and we were number one and all time periods except cash by in the morning I have been quote friends with skinny Bobby Harper for years he agreed to come to work for us but I said what wait a minute I got to try to get daily because if we can get Bailey come across the street and we got no problem with a big winning race of black roses with the operating into him across the Sash and deliver them to the studios at wklo demoralizing trips you know that the mornings were not number one so what happened was that the Al Smith and I went out but still one I've met him in the bar they would hang out and stayed up with it really late and we got a little sloshed and of course we told him that we wanted him really bad took him back to the wacky Studios and typed up the contract you signed it was going to come to work for us it was a 4 in the morning maybe 5 a.m. even I don't know and actually I wanted to put him on here that very morning he wouldn't do it cuz he had a loyalty to the station if you picked in padded yellow so he went over there and when he sobered up I guess he lost his food he hasn't come to work to Wacky even though we operate it twice as much money as he was making the time of the probably thirty thousand for something at that time $15,000 is a lot of money A Little Love in Your Heart shomari let me tell you how it is between me and my winter Bill Bailey's been 4 years at Radio wklo until one of the biggest top 40 stations in the nation Came Calling With a Little Help from wklo is main competitor whky again so we put together a bunch of ratings for the last couple years and I did an air check of aliens called LS and found out that look was out of town I think he was on a monitoring trip cuz he was looking for morning man I think it was called and I talked to the hotel he was staying at found out that she was indeed there until we ship the package out and the rest is history books. Wow this guy strong cuz I'm trading for currently Solid 4 years and he offered daily the job is Cody Wy last than they took the job and left town which was great but we hired heartburn pain with heartburn in the morning and Bailey gone to Market was wide open I've just been informed by telephone that the hog is willing to take on all you girls when I can accommodate this morning but I did not get a rest assured that I'm going to be playing the game with you going to play this game is Roberta Bunnell and this is my way of saying goodbye to her this is her favorite song the old made it to Mornings in the windy city named the Duke of Louisville so I flew in Louisville late one night got up early the next morning at 6 in the morning and turn on the radio and within 30 minutes and I you was what I was looking for a to do mornings it wi last he seemed to have it all a sharp wit and humor very distinctive voice almost at the TJ's dial he represented the common folk to remember that you didn't put on any airs he was judged himself very natural he commented on items of interest in the matter than Mike we just say answer to it and pretend to be anyone but himself much like dick me out they became a Chicago Legend I expect to build do the same thing at WLS this morning man break your radio personalities complained that he reminded me of a modern-day Arthur Godfrey but much of him kind of Charmed just a touch of looking like an Irish delivery remember his early radio career when I checked him out with similar to that of Larry Lujack some gloves and still is a legend in Chicago radio they both had the a personality that challenge authority which I didn't mind at all eyes that's kind of personality Reedy management members of the are making fun of their boss was just like the Common working man would love to do so they gave related to that type of personality. that's always been one of my favorites that still that's got to be my all-time favorite song I'm going to take that with me Broadway Chevrolet is located on Broadway at 7th Street hello young fellow call Gina Austin hit song ask I'm going to I'm going to say thanks to you because I honestly believe that my association with this station has matured me to the point that I am capable of taking that job in Chicago and I'm going to succeed because you asked me to and I'm not going to disappoint you I'll make that promise to you right now thank you very much and goodbye I thought maybe she called me but she didn't do that I got a feeling I'm not around anymore well I'm sure she's going to be in town come Monday and when she gets here first thing she's going to invite you over for dinner well when she invite you over for dinner looking giving you a warning right now don't accept decline the invitation I don't care what kind of excuse you have to come up with just don't come over for dinner because his wife am I don't know too much about cooking every time she says to me how she comes into the living room on musically stretched out there on the couch you know it's been a lot of my time in a horizontal position she comes in that, she wasn't sure if she threw it to the hall of fame throw it back to 65 degrees Bobby's guys I'm seasonal temperatures through Saturday night today and tomorrow 83 low tonight 63 on the fence guys have 65 or Continuing Story peppermint rainbow 7:22 WLS experience and why even while making serious money doing mornings at a top 40 station in a Major Market the dream of nearly every small and medium Market DJ in the country why wasn't he happy they're great commotion because they gave me the freedom to pick my own floater man so I took a man from Louisville with me together Eddie and I made the number one ranked in their 4 months or five months number one already and I guess I couldn't get along with the people up there is John to tell you the truth and I can't stand a big egos just told into themselves you could not even talk to them you didn't mention their names on here don't talk about me I'm what you're talkin about me I don't talk about you man if you want me to talk about it I just let me know if people have no sense of humor know nothing as I had to get out of there I need a phone a DJ but the people that had to work with on the air now we're just to screw over their own importance and on and I keep telling myself you know you're nothing but a working but I'm just like everybody else trying to make a living and that's what they were true but they felt they were a heck of a lot more than that just couldn't get along with the only one I can really say I like was Larry Lujack from Boise Idaho and course I lived on Idaho to so he and I were pretty close to her if you don't that's a little young guys coming are you know there's like a heck of a lot of money I've seen Larry Lujack this and pull out a roll of bills in handy one guy on hundred-dollar Bill inside yourself something nice kid cardi B ever go to give it all the way back to show for a special trip over here when I get home I guess you know that's right, he is inspecting troops at Camp McCoy near La Crosse Wisconsin about 5000 into been so long since I was a part of Uncle Sam's on horses I'm trying to forget about it about 1000 Chicago area National Guardsmen will be a part of the 5000 man contentions there 5,000 stall are from Illinois than 1,000 of them are from the Chicago area at present Glen Campbell very nice song if they do take my hand before a y o w s perspective on Bailey's unhappiness at the big 89 Chicago just a bit more for matter that he was able to accept w2ls had been beaten soundly by wcfl with me readings prior to my arrival there in 67 and so of course to replace to an awful lot of importance of the amount of Music we played the old would probably more comfortable being a talk show in the morning and he was the music and so it just didn't quite fit to the format but I thought I could probably get him to be a little bit more brief in his comments and play some more music and he just was the Bill Bailey Direction and he didn't sound like Lujack and so many others that I've worked with the heat made up his mind that the he was going to be exactly what he was which is fine you know and was it just a few months he returned to a little bit after six months that's what I can't stand it here it's all right I got to get away from you and do they understood what I was talking about later but he fired the program director cuz they don't like he was the one that the initiated a whole thing about my getting upset the middle leaving aren't Roberts was the one who kept stabbing me in the back you listen to me in the morning you could tell I was on that Nicolas John rook and tell John Rook what I was doing is John would go pick him up or are Roberts will go pick him up and I both go flying into the radio station stop me from doing what I was doing what they couldn't do it I kept right on doing what I was doing and if I hadn't they would never have been number one that's the amazing thing about this one every other time so I looked up in the morning than they ever did get another one in the morning that's powerful as they were then there was a good reason why they couldn't get number one I had those guys I get home to talk about your Yachts out in the lake and knowing their private playing all that stuff in this was going to work and people not everybody can afford all this stuff they left WLS that was an interesting thing because he was hired by Rook to WLS rookies and I talked about that and I told him that the baby was a handful but if he was willing to really work with him that he was worth it and Rooks didn't understand what a handful of I was trying to describe to him and he hired him that he was not prepared to put up with a lie and Crossways and then Bailey when he quit WLS in Chicago I'm going west and Brooke called him into the office and said they are waiting just came in congratulations you're number what is is good I can accept any came up to know walk you stay busy for a couple days and I don't think she had a job there's all kinds of stuff about wacky being responsible for him going to WLS and all that I don't know where that true or not but when he left there he did not have a job and I suspect he probably would have enjoyed coming back today with your tail out except if they would not have paid in the kind of money that he had been making in Chicago and I think I'll be waiting a while I tried to pay at least for a dual stage of the big 89 in Chicago once again John real estate in Chicago and taken just a little more Direction he probably would have been a major voice nationally like Oprah Winfrey many others who came out of the Chicago

David Katz the Duke of Louisville and people think that's how he really was out he really is is that true well yes that is true but really different from that in a lot of people really don't know bill the bill was always very well-read I was always impressed by his knowledge of the Bible did he never wore this on his sleeve or anything but you just think I picked up over years working on the 10 years with it now. To this day I don't know his religious preference or his political leanings the back but there's an awful lot of integrity and I wanted to let Bill know how much it is meant to be personally and professionally and how many Greer's he is started how many people not just radio people but how many flippers really loved and respected guy over the years it has been years since he's been on the wagon and Kayla we should still have people still talk about and I want to build know just what an important marks an important footprint he is made in radio in Louisville you know when the whole thing was over with. I think we all just kinda said well it's been great lot of fun we went about our separate ways but the one thing that does remained is that. There's only one guy in the world you're never be another one again to get that the demographics and ratings with his hat does that this Bill Bailey read what you have there for Naughty 300 block of Preston Highway an accident use contrite in this area I really don't have anything to complain about this morning I was going to complain about a number of things that are in significant rate Lisa wants to you complaining about him Bailey's other co-workers and wacky think about working with the Duke of Louisville and I guess the highest compliment to me he was absolutely he is is great I did Chargers out there I would do character voices I would do Impressions and things like that a character he was an absolute by himself Standalone individual in Louisville if you put what you want to have a beer with Bill Bailey president would win every time race to the radio to turn it on Jason O'Brien the guy I truly thought that he was probably the best Storyteller that is ever been on the face of the planet I used to be amazed The List of Demands and I'll be on my way back home listening to him and I couldn't tell if he was making stuff up or not it was one morning I remember one particular visit he did and he was doing his thing about had a romantic evening last night and he don't have a gravelly voice and he would talk about it back in the evening taking a bath by candlelight and everything was by candlelight and it went on for about 45 minutes until you finally learned that Louisville Gas and Electric and cut his power off and I remember he got out of here probably close to 8:45 my friends my good neighbors my good friend I demand that you call Louisville Gas and Electric and have the Dukes electricity turned back on about 9 9:30 I think the president of LP&L call Don Meyer the general manager of time called him and said stop it you had enough calls will turn the electricity back on in the early seventies when I was working there that they used to park his car he was running late he's parked in the alley behind a garnet got towed off one morning they got on here and call the police chief said I admired the man so much and again he was a great Storyteller I'd ever seen I was always amazed before he was always Natalie attired you know I hated this morning where he was late because he just knew that you can't fill in for the Duke of Louisville what year was standing over here now Kevin McCarthy I just got through asking him how long you been here since 10 last night first Chris comes in here who's working himself to death now we got Kevin McCarthy doing the same thing you boys realize what you're doing to the rest of us just going to walk up to them how many hours you fellas put in today each one of them can honestly say 10 or 12 hours then it going to come to me and ask me how many hours did you put in today and I won't have to lie and say 10 or 12 hours at 17-17 a story about it Bailey you don't have to fret you don't have to lie to the boss either he knows you're too old to put in 10 to 12 hours keep on talking and we know you and me going to be flipping and flopping the rolling around on the ground that's a wacky Oli 6:20 6:20 that wacky a good morning to you and we will make up the first in the job this morning until 10 and ready for his news report he's busy on the telephone right now taking a news story.

We didn't expect a 79-73 today we look for about 80 to and I'm sure they close tonight anyway it's 60° such a nice level you know I will never forget when I came to Louieville I wanted to hear what the competition sounds like so one morning I was listening to Bill Bailey who was the big day lowest I'm just waiting to be by anybody else but it was to meet I heard him say Well this kid just call me on the phone they told me that some guy is picking on him at school they want to know what he should do and I told you tell that guy that you know Bill Bailey has that doesn't scare him off run because he's probably crazy but other boys will be tough to beat this guy you know and I don't think we didn't really sound like sometimes be able to go out and he was to have a little bit too much to drink and he would call me and ask me to sit in for him you know which I didn't mind doing because people bringing breakfast every morning so I can do that I was going to be fed well if I did it go when I was at home and I got this call from Bill and he said soon as Bill Bailey but you believed I was in a car wreck and I need you to work for me in the morning and that is to Snellville I wouldn't believe that Jesus well would you please I had too much to drink I got the fight with a guy who is 6 ft 4 in a beat the hell out of me.

He works at wklo my father hated hearing it said he was too sarcastic but I thought Bailey was fantastic I was right in the summer of 71 I got a job at waky production weekends off an overnight shift it was a real thrill to meet and work with the Duke of Louisville and made known to the bar for so many years and I did overnight sometime in the morning usually only a few minutes or 40 minutes was a real kick to get to do a few minutes of the most popular Radio Show in Louisville I probably didn't help his ratings but probably a year and as long as people knew the bill was on his way in they would have waited around for him to come in sometimes I be clever and put odds out on what time the Duke might make it in and we actually had a handicap room sometime call in and help out with this is was usually okay with Bailey of course the Duke was infinitely more clever than me on the air him one morning I got my just reward for playing with fire this way on the way into work Michael Lewis Griffin and Michael Lewis Griffin is being replaced there really a powerful personality scanner a little fat Joe Bailey had some kind of special magic going with several nearby restaurants are open in the morning downtown restaurants for fall in all over themselves to send the Duke all the free food and coffee he wanted it sometimes happen that just a little hint by him on the air and read some Coons or more usually breakfast or coffee from Leo's would show up I wasn't even open in the mornings but apparently the head chef was a great fan and staff was in and getting ready for the day when extra people like myself were around in the mornings and the Duke was ready for breakfast would call over to be sure that Leo was soon enough for everyone this is a very tasty breakfast and I believe to this day that it was all due to Bill Bailey's magic nothing more and Bailey was magic if I ever had a radio Idol it was real Bailey he is a master of the air Master Communicator a master happy so I can to Keeler he served a great breakfast on a show thank you Bill Bailey from many years of magic and all the great entertainment must have read my mind my own business was just a word to mean the radio control room here's a guy who receives more requests for himself inside the ropes. Enough sitting here listen to the level of play Bailey was at made me think on the drive back to Shelbyville that morning that it would take me to Lifetime to work every possible angle inside and sometimes outside the lines with format in order to relate one-on-one with his audience River City Mall either way he had it to burn sitting three feet away while he worked I noticed how everything behind the mic seem to be so effortless or something he wants to tell you listen to one of his competitors on the way in on one of the other top stations for Zachary's and bills opinion the man should find a line of work that he would truly enjoy Luther Ingram If Loving You Is Wrong I Don't Want to Be Right where you going to be a DJ this week I don't want to be right there play why 64 degrees just about decided that is not the food but the coffee that's in my chest every morning think I'm going back to my Salt Lake City buljan Gary Glitter even listening and other than occasional hell or damn like the morning the police record do Oldsmobile Cutlass Supreme from the back of the language you use on the program is number one ratings came the old-fashioned way with talent to give a glimpse of how his popularity crossed all the demos as far as my junior high school middle-aged moms and dads and grandparents the pulse of the Dukes tasted menswear in Lemoore the traditional side which is perfectly place of employment was on the line with listen to the National local beat around the bush and he had an uncanny knack for laying his opinion on the line in such a way that whether you were the average man or woman on the street or a doctor or lawyer or Indian she immediately where he stood was so well grounded in fact logic and common sense that you knew we was right there's a line for my favorite movie is fast wife pushes himself so hard to extend a talent to its full potential and he replies someday when I walk down the street I want kids to be able to say Hey There Goes Roy Hobbs the car was and so it is with this one very special radio personality Bill Bailey Z Duke of Louisville what is a record by the Jimmy Castor Bunch that's really coming up on the popularity charts not only here in this area but all over the country troglodyte you know who buys just record and make it makes it popular the dumb one but don't know what the word means saying they want to keep it popular until I can locate it in the dictionary I just maybe they're up to the fees by now they take it one page at a time it's going to take some time and you going to have it on this program this program got a little plasma every morning finer person I've ever worked with as far as an Entertainer if you were to look that word up in the dictionary of the name Bill Paley communicate one-on-one with the common person in the common person when I say that I mean that 70% of your audience and just I think always had his thumb on the pulse of what that 70% of the market with thinking and although perhaps not all of them liked what he was saying they would all listen in to see what the heck he was going to do next very powerful I'll never forget the time that she put out the word that I was having some marital problems and I wasn't but that doesn't make any difference to Bailey and my poor wife and my poor children the problems were just getting probably needed some help and lo and behold it wasn't a matter of just a couple of 3 days before she can food arrived at the radio station and some check came in the mail anyone else would have done that I probably would have taken it personally and been mad but Bailey had just a way about him that he could pull that off with the Bill Bailey sometimes it didn't make it till the end of the day you never knew you was going to do but yeah every day was a pleasure going into work with Bill Bailey because I mean I was the student and he was the teacher I learned a little bit more everyday about the big monkey chewed Tobacco on the streetcar line jumped over the lazy dog facts 7 years old and tell him what you said read what you do for a living being played I should say benefit games it's while they Mighty acts memorial fund that's at Saint Helens field and Shively the first game will be played at 7 that's this coming week at wacky's truck Jackson talks about Bill Bailey I didn't show up for work there was a several times that I went on here at 10 and didn't get off till 6 the next morning it'll daily you know he would just come in sit down at 6 in the morning and open the microphone and it would just come out he would just take what what's going on in the community and in the world and turn it around and put a little humor into it I listen to it when I was in grade school when he did mornings at wtlo useless to him every morning thought he was just fantastic and then I got to find pleasure of working with it all but a guy freejaden Manville were hand-in-glove what a show they used to put all these day was fantastic to listen to a muddy mess of WJZ-TV in Baltimore bebalu because he mastered the art of speaking to you as you don't have a command of the language that was unparalleled it was in a way you had never heard before and he spoke to you once again not at Brent Howard Cosell had a great command of the language but used to in fresh and announced to speak at Perkins will take less you believe that he meant it because he told me you didn't announce it at only reminder might a been a TV for 30 years when I was visiting your phone radio on TV too loud to gripe don't we know all of a sudden got real serious and looked at me and you said you can hate them but you better love your audience so what do you mean you said it's simple if you do not know your audience Bratayley doing a Morning Show is I do on TV given amount of good morning radio he said if you don't love your audience they're going to know it and you're going to fail you can gripe about your employer if you can disagree with the job that you better love your body that he stopped looked at me and not it is if this a kid that's guarantee that's Elton John KY but the dude what a great wacky Scavenger Hunt is coming Randolph is wacky program director in 1977 in the program the radio station till 1979 with Bill Bailey is probably a little different than most one he's somebody I actually grew up with listening to on the radio and finally somebody who I work with is his program director Back in 77 77 when family first one on the scene in louiville Taylor been sent here from another dimension she wasn't wearing hippie jock and he didn't have a rap like the rest of us want to be Josh could copy like we could stay a while and Decker or Ally gray he wasn't young he wasn't old he wasn't Country Wasn't cute he was just real real in a way that incubated people like Stern real and that he played out his wife on the radio you knew where he bought his groceries what kind of car he drove voted for and how much sleep you got the night before you knew if there was a bug up his ass and you knew what that bug name was some of the most Soulful moments I think I have ever heard on radio we heard about his wife cramps we heard how many days until countdown what names they were toying with you name it like a soap opera this man unbutton his life and showed us what a tremendous big heart he had a man how his life was exactly like ours he was like this every man quite frankly was at a point where the management thought bill was getting a little complacent and although I've kept this a secret for a little more than 25 years I was appointed as the bug to go up and moving into this Take This Job and Shove It attitude about work and Bailey annoying me as his memo I made me a really good for a while I wasn't really comfortable doing it I have two men and it wasn't anything close to it dynamic between us between boss and employee Dynamic to quote on quote sleeping in my own bed without the benefit of clergy Bailey was was not very shy at all quite frankly about hearing my laundry out in public much to the Chagrin of my girlfriend's mother and her brother conservative with their friends one of the things that I discovered that they were both frustrated artist and I know you hadn't had a chance or taken the opportunity to let loose with some of that creativity for quite a while the first thing that came out of that that kinship was our version of Randy Newman short people at least listen to while people production was fairly Elementary we used to take out the vocals one of the same tricks I used on Barbra Neal but it gave Bella a rock They Carried into a birthday party I got him some new water cooler play on some of the George Burns consulted just want to sound like short people into tall people do bail 879 wakyoto school rules in the sky the only one they got not too long after that close encounters the movie was being released and we came up with some cockamamie idea called Close Encounters of the 79th kind to play off of Close Encounters of the Third Kind it was your typical play the tones and going to win contests but the jewel in the crown was how Bailey kick the whole thing off your own theater of the Mind come up with something that is totally awesome at a time back to McClendon's wacky debut who played Purple People Eater between those little freak outs episode must have lasted an hour or more in any PD who is driving through Louisville probably thought we lost our marbles probably add but it worked like a charm any time that we could get the cops to come down to the radio station to make sure everything was all right. here's a little bit of what it sounded like failing in Close Encounters of the guy on wacky's Close Encounters of the Third Kind weekend at 6:19 6:19 wacky time Bill Bailey and I believe we have Bill Graham standing by with a brief report for us spell I think bill has been there we are okay this morning I know I have you noticed that there are two or three automobiles in the alley that's simply stopped running a craft one of those UFO was just hovering overhead a very nearby that happens that large crowd at the River City Mall is a transmission from across the river will be by laser beams from an extraterrestrial craft weird things are happening around here now my ashtray that was standing directly in front of me mysteriously it's disappeared and all of a sudden it reappears but thank God whoever caused it to disappear and reappear had the decency to clean it for me thank you very much spook at wacky I'm a close encounters weekend of the 79th kind internment rights do a loan of 15 this is Val Bailey with more Close Encounters of the 70s guys hope you have a very strange presence in the studio this morning for some reason we know what about your thing lo15 tomorrow snow ending and cloudy height snowing in Cloudy High reading about 28 degrees tomorrow what are you expecting Sia reading today personally both pretty chill degrees this look up had several creatures in the past try to control me you'll be stuck and I divorced each and every one of them so get thee away from me evil creatures from outer space or another world where were you from it looks like it's going to be an all right date them I like it was yesterday maybe just a little bit woman it's 9:21 ladies and gentlemen in the past 10 or 15 minutes something has happened to our Duke of Louisville bill would you care to explain what your problem is I don't want to give him something to play on his my Bill Bailey Story Probably are but it wasn't impossible to work with improbable sometimes but never impossible the part most of you don't know is that he's a very real very passionate very loving person without his help we would have had the success we had and I personally have never learned the value of Personality their well-earned freedom on the radio without his guts there would not be a Howard Stern in there probably wouldn't be a Rush Limbaugh are many of the talk show host there are today Bill Bailey is an original along with cord McClendon and Johnny Randolph and Jerry Burbank trust me he is one of wacky's four horsemen 1976 transition to the new store I think was the most talented person that I ever worked with or against for that matter go Bailey was a genius. He had Gary Burbank in my book are both Geniuses the difference is in Gary will be the first person to tell you this Gary spends hours of time off the air in preparation for a show in writing and recording and planning and we're as Bailey would just walk in and any show prep you have done was strictly in his head Bailey didn't even use and I don't think you knew how to patch the phone through the board so since we didn't have anybody to play off of you would either playoff the news person or he would talk to himself which kind of got to be a characteristic of a Showboat inform it was almost like listening to Mark Twain live start telling a story and it would be seamless there were no pause the patient's it was a fully conceived work of art from beginning to end and yet so far as I know it was almost entirely extra brain is he was a tremendously funny guy and he was a great guy to work with you part of my job just drive to me by the president of multimedia Corporation was to go out with Bill whenever bill went on a bender in to make sure that the art and was settled Mentor in any fights and that he got home safely so I was the only guy that I know of his job description included getting drunk but Bill was always a very generous thoughtful guy and I have to say sometimes when I listen to old are checks at my work with him I still cringe at some of the things I said and wonder why he didn't just slap me upside the head cuz I probably deserved it but was very protective and very considerate with people that he worked with in and was fine gentleman a talented artist to buy the Wave A lot of people don't realize if you seen is happen we'd like to know about it be sure to call w a k y 59 News Kentucky and weather partly cloudy with a chance of showers today tonight and tomorrow at 6 to 7:32 what's the guy's name again Danielle Owens yeah, he's married to Roy Rogers right you're thinking of Dale Evans I don't I don't know if they was married or not cuz I'm already to his job to be going to help him out he was married to his job you talk about dedication man he is one of the kids are allowed in the clubhouse I thought I'd take a baby Jupiter up there with me some evening and let her pick up was it too for me so I could be wrong but I don't think they are they don't think they all read I do recall ever seeing any children in their Quest have seen some guys lose their money that I acted like children in a matter of fact I think I could have been accused of that a couple of times that I'm stomping my feet and using Voice language just doesn't go over in a very select route such as we have up there right here eating all that but next time around is going to have to be a class race man they named a race after you once before no oh yeah couple of times but from now on it's going to have to be the Bill Bailey handicap is going to have to be in a lot more drunk right isn't that the build yourself I spend every waking moment behind this microphone trying to develop your reputation and you spend every moment kind of illness all the way back to your childhood so your mother and your father put you in the rowboat they got in the Rose Bowl beside you they put you in tow they took you out to the middle of a new set you adrift out there since that time you've gotten the impression that nobody wants you nobody loves you yeah but a princess discovered me among the reeds when you start thinking things like this nobody wants me nobody loves me just remember this you're probably right you among the Reeds thing to say some Egyptian princesses I recall an Egyptian princess atop an empty milk container plastic container with a long cord running down to the bottom of the Arkansas River with a big piece of fatback tied to the end of it hopefully a snapping turtle would get a hold of that and you a big old catfish on a big old catfish out to every morning you're the goddess picking on me I'm saying nice things about you the best defense is a good offense I know you're offensive enough all right program director in 1979 in an interview recently I was talking about are talents that I'd really respected and I said you know Charlie tune in Los Angeles was my morning man there no Bailey in louiville John Lanigan and Cleveland the OMG Kelly would work for me in the LA is done morning for me in Las Vegas and some other places animated slip.and I said you know Bailey was probably the best morning man I've ever worked for and the interviewer said you said you worked for Bill and I laughed and said you know when you think about it I really did is Bailey was the boss let there be no mistake if Dylan wanted it it was going to happen and if he didn't want Phil to do something you had to find a creative way to get him not to do it they always prone to read your memos on the are you would sometimes do us the exact opposite of what you instructed him to do Choice Emily realize one day this is his Persona Bailey is the anti guy easy anti manager he has the contrarian he's going to go the other direction cuz that's part of his that it's part of who he is and once I realize that and went out of my way to give him the tools he needed to do his job we were really got along great why would probably say my first you're working with Bill was a real talent my second year I wish it was really very good how much is a Thursday morning just the most reading of 560 degrees 11 before 7 minutes before 7 a.m. with country music country music wow old dogs and children and watermelon wine make sure about to retire you can consider that you would one great song Today Hello darling how are you this morning I didn't shave this morning. Leon I must be drawing September 4th at 5 p.m. this weekend music George Francis was General Manager between 1978 and 1981 and he talks about working with the Duke of Louisville when I arrived in 1978 my job was to update the radio station change the mission in developer station into more of an adult radio station in the process of building a team to do that obviously they had to be changes in the sap and remember this is back in the seventies this is before email and faxes etcetera so as an employee left the station I would put out an official memo saying that so-and-so had left the station and we wish them well in the new Endeavors I found out that Bill Bailey was actually reading these memos on the air bill would play Taps like a military funeral and he read the memo on the chair and is deep sultry voice I was not happy about Bill doing that I had spoken to the PD at the time and ask him to have Bill cut that out but it continued like many other things with Bill and wrote a direct memo to Bill specifically telling him that he was not to read internal memos on there that it was unprofessional but it was inappropriate well to my surprise the next morning I'm riding into work listen to the radio station and Bill is reading live on the air the memo specifically telling him not to read memos I can say that's working with Bill for years was certainly a unique experience or perhaps I work for Bill I must respect I'm not sure how that works the one thing that probably we all learn from bill was that don't take life too serious serious reveal he didn't do show prep he didn't even come to work on time sometimes he didn't even come to work but Bill legendary funny guys to ever be in this business I consider him a great friend I'm a great fan it was a privilege to work with him all things must come to an end including Bill Bailey's decade-long run is a big 79 in lowest level and I said I'm not going to play the crap I'm just not going to do it so I said I think I'll go country so I went over to WCI I started playing country music but that's the same time I would take some of the stalker of rock music's country music and I ever had over the wagon if that's what he was going to be already another wamc but anyway that was a reason I changed over to WCI and I was there for about four and a half years as soon as I went over there and got the figures. game of that fire goes a manager and the program director the people who hired me I don't know what that was all about this is Mike Simpson with the traffic by the way I got my old bomb for sale in the skyline the downtown newspaper would you like to hear what the ad says for sale real cream puff good runs great ask you a question but I guess for 30 years of my life and I still don't know what it is I've asked several people I guess Billy Bob Joe Barn nice I guess maybe you might say he's an old country boy like I've lived in the country 24 x 40 completely erected building pole pole building building you don't have any I don't either I can figure it out but I'm sure he's going to call and give me the answer I certainly hope so the Nashville network cables country home where they hang the tobacco to drive like a log homes to play the next song of a John Nelly who cleared up my state of puzzlement honestly I have been concerned about that you'd be amazed at the number and types of people that I have a question and I'm talking about people that should have known the answer maybe somebody who makes that particular type of bond maybe that's the guy who came up with that turn to CBS news this morning naked wacky day of the month of January and embarrassing questions have your resolutions have your broken already NCC Mark star where did wacky during the last few months of the radio station history and Christmas of 1985 but he said this is God answer the phone and hear him on the other end up playing like that ice to be aware of the fact that he is subservient to the wishes of the people I can see me standing on the steps of the Rotonda in Frankfurt right now I'm like a governor 8:20 822 time at whky like this guy puts on one heck of a menu this is a guy who knows how to cook but thank goodness he doesn't we'll talk about Gary Clark he serves up some great hits with his wacky rock and roll Monday through Friday now if you and your fellow office workers but like Gary to feature a special list you sent him a note on your business letterhead just address it to Rock & Roll Diner w a k y 558 4th Avenue Louisville 40202 and then give him an opportunity to put all the songs together and we will do everything in his power to accommodate you you got that address that's Rock & Roll Diner Avenue Louisville 402 go to the Rock & Roll diner with Gary Clark is your host begins at noon time everyday forecast for Kentucky radio historian Robert Calhoun in 80 w k l o in his brief appearance of WLS Chicago he hung around wacky until 1981 when he went back to 1080 the frequency now was country is w.c.

This Giants win your saying just being shut down before just a second here Bill Bailey been working at wvlk in Lexington break I'm up here working with Ralph hacker you know the voice of UK Wildcats

you ain't no trouble yourself I'll do that for you that's part of my responsibility is 2:16 with the time at wvlk 59 wvlk radio station this is terrific that's a great operation and I'm glad so glad they put me in charge around here now there aren't going to be any immediate changes I can promise you that catfish is doing a fine job there in the morning real nice YouTube singing love songs what are you trying to find the song of what is that Neil Diamond Barbra Streisand you don't bring me flowers 2:20 is our time at 59 wvlk the temperature is 53 until I get rid of this stuff it'll stain your skin so I understand it's not good for you either 53 is at present temperature but it feels a lot warmer in here maybe it's because I'm you know this is stressful situation that I'm in at the present time but I shall overcome I can promise you that it's going to be such a pleasure working for such a nice people here the station and all you nice people out there in the Lexington area you have always said nice things about to Lexington some of the people in Louisville didn't catch you much about the things I said about Lexington because they always said that Lexington is the city on the role in the state of Kentucky beautiful city beautiful I love it here already it's a matter of fact I was on the telephone just before I walked in and call the mayor's office I said man this is the Duke he says bill it's a pleasure to have you here I said I'm pulling just to let you know I'll be available for consultation send the future and I want to know what love your community so much of already made a down payment with a real estate anyway I'm getting together with maybe talking about some of the things that I'm going to be doing for the city while I'm here and I think you'll find them of interest because you'll be participating also look at together with these things out over maybe lunch sometime in the near future bills with for years in afternoon drive at wvlk but it eventually became time to hang up the headphones I got to pay all up there, and came back with Louise on and when you lose your help you lose everything Bill Bailey's are work is going on to influence a new generation of broadcasters that at least I ever heard of it branded himself and X wklo disc jockey by identifying so much with the city that he worked in just not enough of that goes on in radio today it seems like a very simple programming cool and technique but he was the first to really take that and run with her I mean I think you really made an attempt to reach out and touch people whether does The Working Man or whoever he was trying to relay to at the time because he's the opposite of what a can syndicated Morning Show would be it would be diametrically opposite to that so that we can all learn from how he really reached out to the community and branded himself to the community director who hired Bill Bailey at radio wklo in Louisville in the 60s and me to dental school or law school or chiropractic school or Vietnam I too became a broadcaster and the point is not to talk about me but Bill Bailey truly it's difficult for me to separate what I believe I know about Bailey and Louis V and the few things I witnessed firsthand and the things that I heard of anecdotally and pure BS that I are others made up because Bailey is such a fertile field in which turd blossoms can flourish I mean who can deny anything you tell them about the Duke but I will say this I guess my dad's Tour of Duty is wklo program director was when I was in the shift the 7th or maybe 8th grade area I hadn't heard too many morning shows that knocked me back on my heels then when someone who my age at the time was in the early Elementary School in younger the recognize masters of all time and space at the time where Arthur Godfrey end on McNeil and I'm sorry they suck that was a grown up show those words shows done by Don McNeill on Arthur Godfrey for grownups and it was nothing in it for a kid Bailey and Danny Williams wky in Oklahoma city with the first two local morning radio performers I remember getting there were clearly doing adult programs but I got them I was a kid and I got their act and that was very different Bill and Danny have something in common a capacity for spellbinding keep you on the edge of your seat storytelling sometimes they take minute and minute to tell a story which I'm sure drove some program directors at some radio stations nuts of your silliness or experience into a few words over at 12 second Bailey and Williams Mike to few others in like some great song writers and filmmakers can give you the feeling they were following you around in your life taking photographs of your best moments in your worst moments who's showing the pictures back to you on the radio it's difficult to describe Bailey's success comes to some degree from his ability to Intrigue us all one at a time with a story a story a boring story even a bad joke you've heard a hundred times and his Common Man fax her he is one of us screw the boss that will embarrass my dad but hey Bailey's had more than a couple of ducks on through the years at the expense of his income bride or the bride's of others then to account for the Bailey phenomenon you also have to pour on a big Ladle full of Bailey's bigger-than-life missed his Star Quality it's not just the storytelling and it's not just the one on one human communication with other men and women who also work for a living and who also may enjoy a beer or a baseball game after work Bailey has a difficult to Define and nearly impossible to measure Ignace on the radio at the coffee machine at a betting window at Churchill Downs who in the world cannot listen to Bill Burr that's just a gift it's a god-given gift I've had more than my share of interesting jobs I've met lots of Fascinating People and sometimes famous people and had a lot of shout-outs sometimes from impressing people through the years but I've never ever ever been more thrilled that I was when I was a freshman Cadet at Missouri Military Academy Bailey said good morning to me on his WLS Chicago more I'd like to thank to do for that 35 + years later and I'd also like to thank to do for all the stuff I learn by listening to you that I don't even know how to describe in 1988 and out of work Bill Bailey gets it on Terry Meiners afternoon show on Louisville 84 WHAS to complain all the time you know it isn't my nature to complain like that I will complain about things you know that I was really a four and not against like a woman's live always liked women on manager George Francis it was always putting apologies and I want to apologize for Bill Bailey for saying this but saying that I have to tell them you this state is to say that Adam and he's going to apologize for my saying it but no I'm almost off and I was that's what they wanted they wanted hypercritical guy on the air that's what I was and when I left wacky and went over to WCI it was with the understanding I would no longer have to do that because I'm tired of it cuz there's a stigma that you have to carry when you do that you have a great segment of your audience who enjoys it and loves you for it but you've also got a segment of hates your guts for it I've had my life threatened several times. Twice he had a police over there bomb threats clear the radio station ain't going anywhere I think management wanted me to be blown up a couple of times but misunderstand what you said you had to be very careful how you word your statement because they will misunderstand I want to hear more about the broadcasting can do anything really but the landscape so I'm told open Wildlife but I seems to be dying out and the order now seems to be for a Landscapes I've done the ceiling in my garage I'm going to have to get by and see that sometimes I was on my bike but go on go on and it was something nobody can remember that Bill Bailey so perfect you talk about a radio personality is able to predict the same things going to happen to me first off Bill Bailey is a very difficult employee how do you in a dress that charge haven't asked anybody at work for and it's Bob Moody as Johnny Randolph I never heard anybody know I wouldn't do a thing like that I know I was never a typical employee you tell me what to do with buying program director guidelines for you the way you work tonight right as long as he was satisfied that the people that were Dependable that were efficient and he left them alone and it's nice to work for somebody like that ride you to death but you can't argue with that they destroy your enthusiasm okay Miss number or perhaps of meth number two and a half million dollars a year has the most vicious lie come to understand, whacking a wklo employees gathered along with family and friends to remember the time spent at Louisville's to gray top 40 radio stations of the 60s and 70s along with renewing old friendships we took time to honor one of the town's all-time great Bill Bailey so many careers in this room are you really stop and think about it do you need a gilded Joey Elias and you don't ask me about what they usually say oh yeah tell me about dude Walker name of time when they did not say Bill Bailey everybody asked about over the years and I remember reading book came out Bill's number one in number one in men and women aged 18 to 24 number one in men and women and do you know he was number one from the Cradle to the Grave and that's a true story and I don't think that's ever been done before and for sure it'll never be done again no one is really ever accomplished it little radio what Bailey is done for my career read the label Bill Bailey's all-time greatest disc jockey all right all right bro blue ocean animals all right I don't deserve not only that but if you want to argue about them as my wife feel better my day is a mega you making me cry. OK Google next up it was Mason Lee Dixon what state is called the Feast of Bowen he that outlives this day and come safe home will stand tiptoe when the day is named and Rouse him at the name of Bowen he that shall live this down and see old age will yearly on the visual piece his neighbors and say tomorrow is Saint Albans then when he stripped his sleeves and show his scars and say these wounds I had on Boeing's Dave old man forget that all shall be forgot but he'll remember with advantages what feeds he did this day and then she'll our names familiar in his mouth as household words Bailey the Duke Chris Lundy Johnny Randolph Gary Burbank and dude Walker weird beard makes you believe it should be in their flowing cups freshly remembered this story shelter good man teaches and Bailey Bowen shall never go by from this day to the ending of the world but we in it shall be remembered page 2 we few we happy few we Band of Brothers for he today that sheds his blood with me shall be my brother be he ne'er so vile this day shall gentle his condition and the Jefferson County now a bed jumping themselves accursed they were not here and hold their manhood cheap while any speaks that fought with us upon Saint Bowen's day next game waky general manager and be number one I've never run into so much talent at one time that went through wacky I bumped into people all over the country that know of this station and rightly so but a market in this country I don't think there is anybody better than Bill Bailey Renard a lot of people with great pipes and good feelings and a lot of talent but there was something just nicely. He about Bill come on there and almost swear you'd like it a preacher would say that's good stuff it's so good to see you and the recognition is a long time coming but I couldn't be more deserving good to say yes I was playing golf. Who you are recognized your voice he said you sorry son of a piano that's what you're talkin about he's just what he said he said well you been out to love with all your money away your kids not going to have a Christmas and if people would just bring some peaches or cans of corn by would be so grateful so I see you're kidding me he said it's so I get in the car. The preachers in the cans are going they weren't there but I figure around the corner and Bailey sees me Lisa's don't remember things I've been telling you about dude it's all a lies right outside the window. Haha he's the greatest place I have the words and I work to some great places and I just want to say that to me feel badly is the best disc jockey I've ever heard Johnny Randolph and Bill Crispin to the finest program directors ever work for I guess the broad also heard from Tim time it was fun to meet with the things about the clock that was another course we were the hot shots at the wacky radio and we all listen to him where we wrong want to talk about radio and I talked about this jockeys I was talked about Bill Bailey not tell stories about Bill Bailey because he never had a stick he was just bill it was like taking a ride in the backseat of a Louisville taxis are it didn't matter what morning I was in trouble as I'm done call me and tell me about something I don't know what it was and Bailey was standing on the chair in the studio ranting and raving about his divorce if you work today radio Rush Limbaugh no disc jockey did contemporary radio ever said on the radio when God made anybody else like Bill billion and built has a number of years ago sir Joe Biden from I feel a lot like the sixth wife of Henry the 8th on her wedding night I know what I'm supposed to do but I'm not sure I can make it interesting the luxurious radio career was Louisville and then you stopped every morning and going out and get this brain stop.

start Lonnie Donegan about did between sessions with Chris Barber and they would pull out the base the banjo and the 12 string guitar was the error that started young people in Britain for picking up guitars washboard bases and even sometimes percussion instruments let's go now to grab that influence as we mix it together with a very rare track from the very early Quarrymen yes it's a recorded

Tommy Steele Cliff Richard has that one of the big rock and roll artists just one of his big songs called Rockin the caveman a rock with a Chinese man caveman Style got my head all the people down the

else up to that point track a call to move it before that you heard of the early rockers he and his a theme song for most of his career before that and then rock with the caveman this was the biggest hits of rock and roll era and it was pretty sure it was homegrown Tommy Steele and the steelmen tummy still went on to Major stage Productions because as the Beatles hit after 1962 there was very little room for anybody that wasn't a big group another important note is that one of Elvis Presley did not feed did not tour Britain it was said that in 1958 and the now 71 year old Tommy Steele says that I almost called him up out of the blue one day said I really like your music came over and spent the day with Tommy Steele and not to her let's go to the very back yard of The Beatles now and set this up a little bit the cavern Club as you all know was very important to their career they'll each and everybody that was in the cavern Club had a standard set list and all the groups including the Beatles had to do those set list or else they wouldn't get hired bobbler the DJ ruled at that time if you had a single you'd make sure the Bob wheelerwood plants he would also be your computer or your

Paul and John and he indeed it achieve that one of the finest voices in rock and roll anywhere Billy Council that that is a Carole King song and done in of course the Beatles style you can hear Steve benio on the lead guitar they're just copying those lips that came out of George Harrison's hand before that a group could have been should have been as they were the group that the Beatles wanted to be they call themselves The big-3 that goes back to November of a 1963 a very very rare live recording at the cavern Club a little note of interest is that Brian Griffith the guitar player in that group is now a guitar teacher here in a Cavalry and has left that scene behind many many years ago has many great stories yet to share we are looking at the beetle Roots here on a full crew to the core song writers American songwriter has played a very valid part and let's hear something from his own words Arthur Alexander wrote a song called Anna that the Beatles took to the top of their

I think I think sometimes rules help you know you have problems with which to work and you're always kind of right on the edge of the end that gives you a little juice gone another thing there is a fact that so many people are afraid to be themselves on the radio and when we first moved our radio station know if I work for Cleveland they call me and said we're going to go into New York and I would have gone with one of the big networks because I'm a rather unorthodox radio station he like the Greaseman if that's that's kind of person I want to my radio station cuz you would like for dinner I'm a big fan of he was legendary in Jacksonville for years and when he was in Washington but the thing about it is when you go on the radio and you and you act normal friends insist it's Taboo in most markets in most radio organizations to mention other stations in the market other people we congratulate someone for doing a good job in New York is a fellow my name is Scott Muni he was a wonderful just dragging around for years he's in the hospital we wish him the best and if someone's copying us are doing something we did we talk about it talk about it you knock the other stations as well we've been known to do that on a case there are in the vein of your kind of ability and then try to change them and get everything set from there from the get-go when you're talking to them about the job you have to decide you know what you want to do what they want and I think everybody is clear but all you're ever needed the microphone you have a happy time there but it's when people and I was like a married woman's cuz you was getting the bikini then when she's yours no more bikinis one-pieces trench coats at the beach as the same thing that they put on your house with laughter and then you say why it's funny but I don't know if I could do it on my station will in your slit your own throat what are the parameters got what are the hours of this might be hard to discuss how far do you go one of the first you don't use the seven words you can't use right no we don't we use terminology that people use in everyday life to a certain extent will use a LOL damn we don't use it all the time we don't use it out of context to shopping if it's a natural word that comes out of your mouth and I believe you've been known to utter one of those two words and this is been charged to make fun of ethnic groups and homosexuals well the general pattern of this scholarship through we'd all just a lie so we don't do it and it weighs we don't do it on a consistent basis on Archer we might have something like Frontier decorator you know Frontier from Boston to redecorate the west and it's it's it's not that's not where we call ourselves the Z morning Zoo an equal-opportunity offender nothing serious and that you that it's been said that my should I don't really put down anybody yeah I went through a lot man you said you never get in trouble if you hate everybody equally and then after we don't hate everybody but I think if you're if you're doing it just didn't like fun and I I don't really mean to say the set aside ethnic groups but if if if you have this a whole world of people out there and people are funny and if you do it in the spirit that is amusing then I don't get complaints from any ethnic groups recently at our station was about a month ago I had given my weed wheat we stay away from specific and I we don't do like we don't do the Polish jokes for safe and because of the nature of the show something somebody that represent these guys are fine they make I mean this horrible hate letter in the mail from my local police later he says I will find a way to stop you and it was so strange I read it on the air and all the sudden all these calls came in all my long listen I apologize I'm polish and I love you show me the guy was just he's one of those guys that needed some publicity and wanted us to read the letter your shows are a reference all right I mean you don't have not that's not the right word we don't go by the old guy lines that's true but we have respect ya after these messages from the nation's capital this is the Larry King show this is Rich Little is Johnny Carson inviting you to join me for a marikkas favorite program as a matter of fact Larry talks more than all three of my wife put together Larry with Scott Shannon in the Greaseman where Coast-to-Coast on Mutual is it and this would be the greatest fear of all a fad well I made some good money on the way to the bathroom in the radios on I think we went through this all right then. Maybe I'm still thinking that that's still occurs a format radio in that format when Rock started it was time temperature and play the record a Larry down a hold of you at DJs came along who couldn't do anything beyond tell you what time temperature in play the record but throughout those. There was always a Wily Phillips if you're from Chicago if you're from New York there was a bobbinray in there was a dinner with Arthur Godfrey on the networks and 5th Miami there was Lee Sherwood you always had presented within the management and in Los Angeles lomaland Berkeley why did they why they succeed over all the different they were funny yeah but they were always just use the one in the town right now that's changing do you have somebody that's doing a stick and he's doing well with it, do you free plan your morning I don't I don't do my I just walk in there I read the paper and then I walk in there at 6 and five things some of those some of those two as production pieces yours are magnificent. I think about us than the previous record is playing my son will call up and say hey here's an idea and I'll think about it that's pretty funny though it doesn't believe you I don't believe you but nobody's at intelligent. Specially you how much I want them to see me over the years and do it and testify to this way how much of the zoo is pre pre plant we're very pretty and we have written my partner runs and IBM computer and we we we do about 3 to 4 hours a day on the next day show me and in the afternoon you sit down we do it between 10 and then we would you want protection pieces with JR my production director if we're going to write a song a parody you know we're going out to Yankeetown and you can't compare what Griezmann does what we do it's two different types of shows when you say we're both different but our shows are quite a bit different unique for the morning I want to know that this flamboyant Behavior I think we're both unique and what we do for the morning but nowadays flamboyant behavior is coming the by wait for morning success what about midday back to the easy listening you change midday most stations do 5 because people basically want to hear the music the rest of the day you're amazing I see they don't want to laugh at 2 in the afternoon. They don't want to laugh another one of the things that is very expensive to get into a budget what do you want you know you do you want three highly paid entertainers on a radio station I mean only afford one so the morning man is the guy that gets the most right and then the rest do you think this kind of thing if budgeted that way I could work say 24 hours 5 Zane he's on a station I give it to go if I had the money what the hell let me see it you know if you can get the Five Guys I just over the most hilarious in the world and put them on I give it a shot and see what have nobody's done it let's see nobody's done it we keep sending guys there any women doing what you do Russian women personalities I think that the market is right for the lady boss Jackson listening tonight I think that if there could be a lady that was on there just flamboyant devil-may-care get get people on the phone damn up and down that there a man you know that woman is looking at a hundred G's tomorrow he's right there's been to this day there's been no morning personality female discharge is going to call and say when someone someone Peoria but I don't think in the business has ever been a woman that management except maybe in all new stations put on in the morning weather lady comedians they can be funny like a business to trust a morning to a woman's voice so hungry for morning radio personalities if a certain radio station manager was presented with a great tape what we call Meir checks in our business which is a demonstration of your work as a resume on tape of what you do I think you'd hire and I be I don't give a damn about whether it was a female or male it's too big and too much more competitive business if she's good she'll get judged as being a disc jockey and female do both of your kid politics and politicians what happens to be hot that morning but yes I have done some of it and we're very very much into that we have at on Jesse Jackson singing a song about hymietown right that was real popular in New York that was a short a short hair shortly but we did another when we have we have a school as supervisor the head of the New York school system Anthony Alvarado you may have read interested he's under suspicion off of that way and for money some money that he borrowed from his employees and people so we took an old Supreme song called where the love go and Tony Tony where did you would rewrite the lyrics and it's a very popular song on a station of satire I guess so the Greaseman and Scott Shannon and will be back right after this message Malaysian Capital you're listening to the best of game highlights of previously recorded Larry King shows when you hear phone numbers please do not call Mouseketeers Larry with Scott Shannon of Z100 the zoo station in the Washington do you do a lot of remotes to is it still on after you go out and meet the teams from a bar having of April 26th people can come by I have Bloody Marys at 0 600 and we do parents as you know the weekends I'll be at 2 and record store is you do the do a lot of that number to call for a Greaseman appearance is wait we don't like to do the show out of the studio that much because it's so hard we use the phone so much and a lot of people recorded things how about personal princess record hops is the old man of the old terminology record opening of the new Shopping Center how about to support group isn't any business of queens and country music and hockey players have their groupies and baseball players do you guys get offered when you get very popular television I done some TV I just happened to the Godfrey's in the Bob & Ray is right we seen for a while I've done we're flirting with a couple of offers now in New York but it's you know it's such a difficult job to do a truly wonderful morning shows recent tell you 5 days till we go to 10 hours a day 5 days a week that takes a hell lot of sex Larry right now it's the impression the business that the closest New York it's tougher the competition stuffer and the talent is better is that true well save in Tampa certainly certainly did have a lot of people sending I was concerned when when I moved from Tampa Bay or I had a zoo there and has had to start over again I work sweetheart years and had wonderful people at the radio station overtake Q105 in and the partner that I work with there remained in Tampa and I'm going to New York and it's a brand new station I was a little bit apprehensive but when that kind of thing happens to me probably just like you have been in the past when I do is I just close my eyes all the outside influences and I work but his New York better is the town of better in this competition Suffern New York I got to be honest with you not a put-down to the talent but there's just about the same level of talent for the size of the city in New York is in Chicago and Los Angeles is a wonderful just one of the greatest morning in the country and to take Washington several other fairly good talents I think it's getting to the point where the the revenue is so important that there's always at least two good competitors sometimes up to 4 but the New York the closest New York is necessarily better is not true there's no doubt that Don Imus when you agreed it was considered the number one morning man in America for some of the years but quite frankly in this is only my opinion. I just got tired of doing it and it's just not the old spark from Washington much better in Jacksonville it seems like in the business that people always asking do you want they want to get to New York or La I don't really think that's important I think you got to do your best and then and be as creative as you can be in the relief to me the, the bottom line is you know how much you getting paid I've had guys going to say yeah that's a big time to me I would go there I go to Paducah Kentucky for $400 a year I think he done to me I would have made the big time give me a big old house big ol Southern house is there you know I don't have to go to work in New York in the radio business want New York I was very very happy and and planned on the long long time and Tampa Bay for I'd really love that that area I work for a wonderful organization but the individual that call me mr. Milton Mall some more broadcasting presented in Greece made a very good point a lot of young people in any job is this is Chicago or Milwaukee but the most important thing to me is because of the style that I use in the in the differences in my management style I like to know who I'm working for that's real important to me and it's just nothing and I think it's important to make enough money to support yourself but it's more important to be happy with the people that you work for you would not been of Love Jacksonville to come to Washington if it wasn't more money just to jump markets right I would never go anywhere just to jump Mark if he hadn't provided I was happy where I am where I was and then doing my job is that the general among your peers as well because I'm not really cuz when I was younger that wasn't the real bad if you could jump in Market you jumped you could tell you can tell how long has been in business by the size of his U-Haul for a while there I think it's so stupid to take yourself sell your home if you have a family take your family move into another city when you don't even know the kids are going to work for you there in about 2-3 months do you know what has all my god what have I done I don't want to be you anymore as long as you really get a kick out of doing it to get off the end sometimes your stomach hurts when you walk out of them cuz you've been laughing so hard after the morning and I don't think you ever have to stop for you that you wouldn't be ashamed if you were a 65 year old now that was going to legend that I am station at a gallon and a 60 amp was Father's Day forever wonderful wonderful announcer I mean do you feel I get that question what what's next you come to New York and I haven't conquered New York I had 28 great months and I develop I love being I love entertaining on the radio that's my relaxation relaxation to me that's why I have my fun and you'll do it no matter what age you are news on the IR a word from you say that to me a word from your local stations and will be back with your phone calls for Scott Shannon and the Greaseman two of the four 10 this morning disc jockeys in this country they do what they do when they march to their own drummers this is mutual your network for news and sports satellite find a Chester closed because of a brush fire with by high winds were Smith Air Force Base or B-52 bombers and cruise missiles are station according to Mike.

Sure but he had such a following and send it to your friends all over the country Greece man was like an American Legion in Tampa I'm not with these a logical what guys think of New York and then you left and I don't know why he's retired right now and as matter fact there was a recent incident where another station was negotiating with him and they couldn't come to a settlement so he's he's he's is ready to probably get back in the radio just his partner died he was telling a guy Charlottesville Virginia hello I was going to come to his music. They were betraying the public trust and all that but I thought it was that was a very who ever did that was very sick he responsible individual that is not good radio you thought it was ivy league types I didn't want to say the name of the town I'm there thank you to Virginia hello sound for the good tip grease by they got your braces Maya 57c to sleep fiberglass and I keep burst in the Potomac and his twin diesel sucking gas making the sound that makes a whole person go stand up and cheer and it sounded just started up just to hear the noise will be back after I'm going to cry these messages to the best highlights of previously recorded Larry King shows when you hear phone numbers please do not call here's Larry our special guest tonight or Scott Shannon of Z100 in New York and the Greaseman of DC 101 in Washington Raleigh North Carolina hello I left the Cracker Barrel in Georgia off of years very good condition and are Jeff Davis in Chicago's North Carolina to run down in this area I never really worked I worked in the area but I wasn't really in my Curry I started my friend mobile wabb while I was in the service so I kind of fibbed about my experience and work part-time and in the Fayetteville wfld into w f p s was in the service and then I moved into Columbus Georgia and I got out of the service and started my real radiokorea Maryland hello I got it from New York to agree on that tape that he can make up tomorrow doing good getting up a second or two separate occasions I called him know when you could have done anything like that in and 30/42 he just did it in the mess I never wanted to thank you thank you West Hartford Connecticut hello what's the number one on there was a guy here in the Hartford area in Washington still not for the foreseeable future is always the same one we always call The Greaseman we go to the Pittsburgh hello do that type of people around town that I think you could do personality radio up until around Beyond around somewhere nobody was ever so I don't think any more outrageous that Daddy and nobody I don't think I was ever more than a ride riding stand run family for all his talent I think the last time I went somewhere with your reward any kind of Bud in and one for the Greeks logical enough management that worried you know yourself there were times in your past and just be honest you are extremely talented individual but there were times in your past when you did things wrong and you didn't and you challenged management are you always right same with me when I was a baby DJ I think Grace is always kind of nice to people but there were times when you had some problems too I'm sure you just can't crack it so you have did that just that in a sense of where you are I wasn't inferring it all of the names mentioned by that gentleman but there have been many many different times there comes a time when you start to believe everything right about you and you are God and you're going to tell the general manager what to do if he's still your boss the station will still be on the air when you're gone the one thing true of every one of the business we are all subject to the likes of management if they don't like it they don't like it on the hot line Mobile Alabama I worked wideboy live there if you and Cleveland while you were there I hear I was too distracted wsf for a while and I've got a couple questions for you in New York now I've also used to live in New York and the same way that you did in Tampa and and if so let's say I'm trying to raise myself your house and you format was developed while in Tampa and 54 was still in Tampa doing a very very fine job on that radio station shifted it to took it to New York we altered it to a different Grease Grease Grease when he's in Washington but I would be more than positive that there were some changes and some alterations you made in some of the things you do great radio people don't go from Station to Station and do the same darn thing they did their you have to alter you custom build your program your radio station to fit the community simple as that when I was in Mobile I was a nice Chucky Arizona super sham 7 Belfast John Jack and it was loud and I really wasn't communicating on the level that I communicate now I feel that's where the music is part of your your rap I don't actually talk on the phone or with the music but I do like it's nice you know when you're sitting there thinking what to say if you can come along and not be hating it is it wasn't the doctor on WKRP in Cincinnati pretty much saluting what you guys do wasn't he our image of what you are I hope not you not you don't think it's funny and good and yourself just Jackie's are all arrowheads and Float around and I have personal interest I have personal Hobbies I am more than just a crazy man on the radio and just like my friend but your image perfect the crazy man on the radio are you like every other talk host of course not check to that image on a very well written sitcom how did you regard him sleeping all the time I'm always tired and that's one thing in the morning man you're always just unusual thing about that in and he was kind of close to the person that writes that then put it together who held it was was an admin in Atlanta when I was running a radio station and the actual general manager is a facsimile of a fella by the name of Jerry and all the other characters of blonde Lonnie Anderson secretary was like ours was designed after the station wqxr in Atlanta I was like that show we go to the Charleston South Carolina hello Charleston South Carolina and Jacksonville a 10-9 on a wine whatever he didn't want to take a nap in the Washington Post in Washington to swap tapes you do you know take me and watch it and you have maybe have old tapes from Jacksonville you can swap and people are really Fanatics and you can probably do that that's what I do I can I don't I don't have any tapes for sale in Jacksonville and I don't know if you ever coming back but I want to wish you the best of whatever you might be wanting to do your very kind but I loved you there how many happy hours as I can remember half of it when you do the other guests about the Gringo in Mexico you know a man and I don't know if I can get you didn't Larry Joe and I know if you worry don't worry about that the breaching of wind and washing and then he didn't actually do things are different washing New York hello friend of mine move to Washington Gaithersburg asked about a year ago and everything that he's been telling me about you and every weekend thank you. Totally different than the conventional type of morning something I'm used to and even though have to do with aw and I have to wonder if you think go against the typical Loft no comments and trucks that are done by the DJ I'm going to Scott Chandler Z100 New York City and Greaseman of DC101 in the nation's capital this is the mutual broadcasting system through our Network for news and sports");

Gary Thomas of Gary Indiana who thinks the mystery think it was Dion which is not right he said that this the first time I've listened to your program he says I have a lot of old records some of them go back to 1544 remember a lot of the records that you play said I'm sorry to hear about the Marvelettes retirement wish you were on all night thank you very very much. Gary Indiana is one that goes back to it was recorded in New Orleans Louisiana at the JMM Studios on May 12th of 1953 and it was written by Willie Turner and of course it's a recorded by the great Joe Turner hope you enjoy hearing this one from 1953 it's called crawdad hole call Dad home last time I was down there I broke my line I need to get them in a minute it sure was nice and sweet I didn't get no sleep Dollar Pawn Stone I can't get no more no I'm a butthead and what are you going to do now the river going dry what are you going to do now the real I'm going to sit on the bank and want to call Daddy.

Johnny cry was the winner and he's a lot on the subject one of our local announcers in Michigan came out with a good line recently told me he just finished playing thought you'd enjoy that he said that the song went back so many years that he was still dipping girl ponytails and well when it was popular all right I'm from Chuck Manning Pennsylvania who says he thinks our mystery guest was Damita Jo know if I'm sorry I will do that was by Johnny Cash and the course our winter was Rodney height in the bombings in Heights Illinois he is an artist that we get a lot of requests to play every time we play one of his oldest people start to get excited about it cuz he was such a tremendous the way you got to just recently and had some big big hits or just a short time on the capitol label back in the 50s of this was released in the late nineteen fifty-six Sarah and it was a flip side of a thing called Crazy Legs it's from a mild Ballad by Gene Vincent and his blue caps it's called important words mystery sections I want you to be listening to something a little more but I think you're going to we did it once before in this morning going to have some fun with that we think will get you this week because we have something special planned from Paul chernak chermak of Seward Pennsylvania law say the Belmonts or Dion and the Belmonts theme sorry for all your rock that the information about Richard Berry being on riot in cellblock Number 9 was very interesting however the record was recorded in early 1954 by The Robin's not The Coasters it was a Libra and stole a production on the spark label Atlantic Records probably bought the master and called it a Costa records and two members of the robins and two others did become the coasters at the Smokey Joe's Cafe I don't know why I'm even mentioning this until probably got about 50 out the letter stating the same thing you're the only letter that brought that up and we thank you very very much by the way he says whatever happened to the remainder of your 1959 interviews with the various recording artist you know that I still have those my keep forgetting to bring them I'm at Funicello was on that as you remember and we had Pat Boone and Bill Haley & the Comets and I'll try to remember to bring it in I don't I don't know if we use the Annette Funicello one or not the police and I don't think so but that was very interesting her mother was even in on the interview she was chaperoning it what for seven albums he's worth I guess yeah I've heard of Mac Vickery I thought for sure it was very darvelle I do remember the song evidently someone else did it yes it was Johnny Carl and also thanks for being my little dear hope you can come up with some of the songs I ask for it while we certainly we've got yours listed Mary E Baker and thank you very much in Phillipsburg New Jersey new songs by the same artist I think we played one of these a long long time ago but the reason we're playing is not so much for the artist which very few people probably remember but because of what happened to her her name is Jean Chao Hew recorded for RCA Victor and some of you may remember that way back in the early 50s 5455 RCA Victor started saving the space on record by putting two songs on one side and 2 on the other and they would put one big hit artists on one side and then somebody else in the other and unfortunately Jean Chapel got put on the flip side of Love Me Tender and anyway you want me what you got a lot of money because of the records that were sold it if they sold any like that but this was on the flip side of the records that was sent to all the radio stations in which Elvis did Love Me Tender in any way you want me and we hope you enjoy hearing Gene Chapel first a real short one called welcome to the club and your boys that's Jean Chapel way back when Elvis was doing you want me heartbreak and Don't Be Cruel welcome to the club, no thanks to Sheldon poster engineer this morning who is filling in for Dave Schuster was on vacation and Sheldon was the one that said that sounds a lot like anybody's game o l o s y at North Tonawanda New York just remembers us from working Buffalo and thinks the mystery singer Junior for writing all so well from Mike Baker Ave Altoona Pennsylvania Virginia thanks Jerry Meyers them I'm sorry that several people said Gerry Marsden for that Johnny Carl restaurant in Niles Michigan miles from Perry says your mystery singer Sal Mineo I'm not too sure what it is but anyway we want to say hi and thanks for the program Terry and Eleanor Covington of Niles Michigan thank you very much.
