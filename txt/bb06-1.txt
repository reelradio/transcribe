Working in Winston-Salem North Carolina and I don't recall now how I heard of him whether he contacted Maggie or somebody told me about him a while back and he was doing old-fashioned radio but I heard that voice is unlocked and talk to it and we would talk for hours at a time and I am trying to determine whether or not he would do or could do what I wanted him to do and that was simply to continue to tell the story but he told but I wanted him not to do it 5 or 10 minutes at a time if you do it 30 seconds at a time before I hired him I took the tables are already gutteridge who was our general manager and quite a guy and he took the tape home and in the radio station you didn't hear the magic I don't think he took the Payphone he listened to it while he was having breakfast he said he listened to it while they brushing his teeth and shaving and while it was shaving it hitting and he came back into jail let's do it so we hired Bailey loaning money to get to Lewisville paid him a hundred and sixty-five bucks the way Kenny's Cry-Baby arrived in town they stayed with me for a while till he got a little fleabag of an apartment someplace I found that fan still a door when I arrived this morning if that's good morning Phil Bailey house the dope this morning please say hello to the school cafeteria play something by Bobby Goldsboro for them after 7:30 please 7:39 then do the sign fell Evans and Jim are red white and blue postal Department representatives from the Starks building house about that the agreed that he would start one of these rambling Yarns and then he would talk to about 30 to 40 seconds and no matter where he was or what he was doing and play the next commercial or whatever was coming up where was only a jump back and pick up the story as if nothing had happened at first it was over rugged but got the hang of it but some were convinced wauk LOL let me tell you that is probably coming at you with anything else we listen to as we saw the numbers again first week he works there he came in and quit 5 and during that period of time I think about every disc jockey there came in and threatened to quit Johnny Randolph still Chris Paul the fellows were calling and Mitch's body after a while they sort of worked out he caught on a calm down you relaxed they began to accept him I laughed because it was a drinking problem ever ever so far next door to the station called cabs in about a year after Bailey started they used to slip him out the back of the bar in the afternoon while I was in the year to keep me from seeing and staggered if they knew I could only stays the same guys who were threatening to quit the first week in protecting it they work there any would do in the morning to go before bill was and Bill and firstly everybody else in the radio station was just outraged Glenville daily with her it was like what are they thinking it is terrible you'll never amount to anything and I know you'd betray Bill Chris Baba blah blah blah so bill came into a freak negative environment and terms of employees including me I mean it's not real happy about him being married right away they want into it but after I did it weigh my soul told me that I should do it they don't seem to be very appreciative of it especially Terrell must be nice. There is a great guy for John Laurens and 5 got a petition to get me house they wanted me out of there but I came in at number one already so she had to drop it remaining 1080 Keller Circle they won't be forgetting the magic made wacky years later he was the guy who made it all happen and he drank too much he would go into a bar in the evening and he was saved by a tender my friends and he would not have enough money to pay the bar tab I got a call and save him out of jail or his wife would call me at 4:35 in the morning and say Bailey has a toothache read sicari as bad and he finally we began to Ernie gutteridge general manager was a brilliant man still is we got together and decided to just control Bailey so I remember give me into the office one day complimenting him and I kept pulling unit closer and closer bailed you are the best disc jockey in town no no no no no no no no no forget that you are the best folding disc jockey in the United States know Bailey actually you're the best in the whole world that supposed to mean going to slam my hand out of my desk and I said but you're not worth a damn when you're not here and if you are a late again I'm going to fire you and run you out of town on the other hand Bill if you will be good be here on time and not make it to come and do your show in the morning to do it from now until whatever the date was like 3 months later we have to have tickets at such-and-such hotel in Cincinnati we have tickets to the Coney Island such-and-such a concert and you're going to go over there and have this wonderful week and with you and in The Duchess and the Duke list all on the company while he was as good as gold for those 90 days we sent him home for the weekend and some dinner at about every 90 days 5 months we were sitting someplace if you've been good and you stay good then we took over you got paid and the paycheck was immediately endorsed over to the bookkeeper who paid his rent car payment is everything and then we gave him any money and that way we kept them under control. He was a model citizen wklo general manager Randy Goodrich Brown apparel and a lot of patience and understanding from the staff Billy emerged as the dominant morning broadcaster in Lewisville underneath that blustering humor and sometimes incisive on the air remarks about management in general was a man who thought they needed reassurance not too unusual we all do but with Bill it took a dramatic turn every 3 or 4 months he would resign his request was respect and after discussion I would ask him to think it over and then I would contact the Kentucky State Park system and find a state park that could accommodate bill and his family for a few days broken going to take a long weekend and come in and see me when you got back to see me you just went back on the Arizona thing can happen little visited several state parks as a guest of wklo buddy here and her husband all of us went out to Shakey's wasn't we went out to Shakey's for a little song fast. Then I never had such a good time with my life boy we sang songs like went home about 2 a.m. Blink 182 lunch today and I know why he wants to borrow some money and I mean that sincerely if you have never tasted collard greens and backbone you don't know what life is all about I'll tell you one thing you eat a good mess of greens and butter beans and and I'll tell you once once again Alan Bryant remember why you started working mornings I've been working afternoon and I started talking to each other on the air which he had not been doing before this eventually turned out to be the bill daily stick them in heating plant a business with the radiator for years up the wacky can I do it here and I have two years at a low before you left to go to hell up it was everything good we started talkin talk to you on the intercom because we were sitting right you know so few feet from each other as we were observing things are we going by on the street and I hear thumping radio and dementia to MRI to ask you a question about something in her how is it interacted with him all the time off the year one day after the new skin when it's supposed to be out here is still daily with more hit PC get the record and go you know he said and I could yeah and he starts talking to me about something or locator see where this goes. Next thing you know this is like a regular occurrence where is coming out of every newscast we're talkin about something and he would occasionally talk to me about things during the go and it just got to be almost like a two-man show after while it was really a fund it made morning is a lot more interesting for me because the morning new shift was at Surly dulled to work because nothing new ever happened it was all yesterday's news and you just doing a newscast every and the 3:35. We had a great time and I think part of that and I'm sure you did the same thing as like he is kind of like the typical straight man being a band of Johnny Carson type of thing isn't eating them things to work off of and react to sew my sensitivity was always is there something interesting that I've become aware of that he can play with most of those were things I told him off here to begin with but it was a great time I mean you was there really a natural performer and I mean I don't think he ever prepared for a show I don't think they'll ever sit down and said okay what am I going to do today if you just sat down at the microphone turned it on and let it roll Jodeci I wonder if I mess with the audience would you mind getting some of that material to my face haven't made a caustic comments 2 months 3 audience what you just told me about them pushing the buttons here in louiville I don't remember that way you know if you get up there in a big city of Chicago and you work hard and save your money but those pennies away boy than two or three years you'll be able to afford to buy yourself a taxi cab in New York City what's the difference in car dealers and held the title to Duke of oil originate he's a great guy and probably the best together a long time, this modeling business from me and I'll try to get him to come to Louisville he was the Duke I mean that was it was fun to listen to him every morning especially early because you never knew what it was going to say you always told stories about worry Phil the night before and I don't know how much of it was true and how much of it was probably got it sure was fun to listen to it really was a big problem for us cuz you know we had to play the morning man that could be filled daily please turn the station around I think it's March of 69 with the battle of the Giants which is an old my Joseph formatting that he's used a teener the battle of the Giants huge promotion and return the station around immediately but we couldn't crack the morning I mean operating came out in April and we were number one and all time periods except cash by in the morning I have been quote friends with skinny Bobby Harper for years he agreed to come to work for us but I said what wait a minute I got to try to get daily because if we can get Bailey come across the street and we got no problem with a big winning race of black roses with the operating into him across the Sash and deliver them to the studios at wklo demoralizing trips you know that the mornings were not number one so what happened was that the Al Smith and I went out but still one I've met him in the bar they would hang out and stayed up with it really late and we got a little sloshed and of course we told him that we wanted him really bad took him back to the wacky Studios and typed up the contract you signed it was going to come to work for us it was a 4 in the morning maybe 5 a.m. even I don't know and actually I wanted to put him on here that very morning he wouldn't do it cuz he had a loyalty to the station if you picked in padded yellow so he went over there and when he sobered up I guess he lost his food he hasn't come to work to Wacky even though we operate it twice as much money as he was making the time of the probably thirty thousand for something at that time $15,000 is a lot of money A Little Love in Your Heart shomari let me tell you how it is between me and my winter Bill Bailey's been 4 years at Radio wklo until one of the biggest top 40 stations in the nation Came Calling With a Little Help from wklo is main competitor whky again so we put together a bunch of ratings for the last couple years and I did an air check of aliens called LS and found out that look was out of town I think he was on a monitoring trip cuz he was looking for morning man I think it was called and I talked to the hotel he was staying at found out that she was indeed there until we ship the package out and the rest is history books. Wow this guy strong cuz I'm trading for currently Solid 4 years and he offered daily the job is Cody Wy last than they took the job and left town which was great but we hired heartburn pain with heartburn in the morning and Bailey gone to Market was wide open I've just been informed by telephone that the hog is willing to take on all you girls when I can accommodate this morning but I did not get a rest assured that I'm going to be playing the game with you going to play this game is Roberta Bunnell and this is my way of saying goodbye to her this is her favorite song the old made it to Mornings in the windy city named the Duke of Louisville so I flew in Louisville late one night got up early the next morning at 6 in the morning and turn on the radio and within 30 minutes and I you was what I was looking for a to do mornings it wi last he seemed to have it all a sharp wit and humor very distinctive voice almost at the TJ's dial he represented the common folk to remember that you didn't put on any airs he was judged himself very natural he commented on items of interest in the matter than Mike we just say answer to it and pretend to be anyone but himself much like dick me out they became a Chicago Legend I expect to build do the same thing at WLS this morning man break your radio personalities complained that he reminded me of a modern-day Arthur Godfrey but much of him kind of Charmed just a touch of looking like an Irish delivery remember his early radio career when I checked him out with similar to that of Larry Lujack some gloves and still is a legend in Chicago radio they both had the a personality that challenge authority which I didn't mind at all eyes that's kind of personality Reedy management members of the are making fun of their boss was just like the Common working man would love to do so they gave related to that type of personality. that's always been one of my favorites that still that's got to be my all-time favorite song I'm going to take that with me Broadway Chevrolet is located on Broadway at 7th Street hello young fellow call Gina Austin hit song ask I'm going to I'm going to say thanks to you because I honestly believe that my association with this station has matured me to the point that I am capable of taking that job in Chicago and I'm going to succeed because you asked me to and I'm not going to disappoint you I'll make that promise to you right now thank you very much and goodbye I thought maybe she called me but she didn't do that I got a feeling I'm not around anymore well I'm sure she's going to be in town come Monday and when she gets here first thing she's going to invite you over for dinner well when she invite you over for dinner looking giving you a warning right now don't accept decline the invitation I don't care what kind of excuse you have to come up with just don't come over for dinner because his wife am I don't know too much about cooking every time she says to me how she comes into the living room on musically stretched out there on the couch you know it's been a lot of my time in a horizontal position she comes in that, she wasn't sure if she threw it to the hall of fame throw it back to 65 degrees Bobby's guys I'm seasonal temperatures through Saturday night today and tomorrow 83 low tonight 63 on the fence guys have 65 or Continuing Story peppermint rainbow 7:22 WLS experience and why even while making serious money doing mornings at a top 40 station in a Major Market the dream of nearly every small and medium Market DJ in the country why wasn't he happy they're great commotion because they gave me the freedom to pick my own floater man so I took a man from Louisville with me together Eddie and I made the number one ranked in their 4 months or five months number one already and I guess I couldn't get along with the people up there is John to tell you the truth and I can't stand a big egos just told into themselves you could not even talk to them you didn't mention their names on here don't talk about me I'm what you're talkin about me I don't talk about you man if you want me to talk about it I just let me know if people have no sense of humor know nothing as I had to get out of there I need a phone a DJ but the people that had to work with on the air now we're just to screw over their own importance and on and I keep telling myself you know you're nothing but a working but I'm just like everybody else trying to make a living and that's what they were true but they felt they were a heck of a lot more than that just couldn't get along with the only one I can really say I like was Larry Lujack from Boise Idaho and course I lived on Idaho to so he and I were pretty close to her if you don't that's a little young guys coming are you know there's like a heck of a lot of money I've seen Larry Lujack this and pull out a roll of bills in handy one guy on hundred-dollar Bill inside yourself something nice kid cardi B ever go to give it all the way back to show for a special trip over here when I get home I guess you know that's right, he is inspecting troops at Camp McCoy near La Crosse Wisconsin about 5000 into been so long since I was a part of Uncle Sam's on horses I'm trying to forget about it about 1000 Chicago area National Guardsmen will be a part of the 5000 man contentions there 5,000 stall are from Illinois than 1,000 of them are from the Chicago area at present Glen Campbell very nice song if they do take my hand before a y o w s perspective on Bailey's unhappiness at the big 89 Chicago just a bit more for matter that he was able to accept w2ls had been beaten soundly by wcfl with me readings prior to my arrival there in 67 and so of course to replace to an awful lot of importance of the amount of Music we played the old would probably more comfortable being a talk show in the morning and he was the music and so it just didn't quite fit to the format but I thought I could probably get him to be a little bit more brief in his comments and play some more music and he just was the Bill Bailey Direction and he didn't sound like Lujack and so many others that I've worked with the heat made up his mind that the he was going to be exactly what he was which is fine you know and was it just a few months he returned to a little bit after six months that's what I can't stand it here it's all right I got to get away from you and do they understood what I was talking about later but he fired the program director cuz they don't like he was the one that the initiated a whole thing about my getting upset the middle leaving aren't Roberts was the one who kept stabbing me in the back you listen to me in the morning you could tell I was on that Nicolas John rook and tell John Rook what I was doing is John would go pick him up or are Roberts will go pick him up and I both go flying into the radio station stop me from doing what I was doing what they couldn't do it I kept right on doing what I was doing and if I hadn't they would never have been number one that's the amazing thing about this one every other time so I looked up in the morning than they ever did get another one in the morning that's powerful as they were then there was a good reason why they couldn't get number one I had those guys I get home to talk about your Yachts out in the lake and knowing their private playing all that stuff in this was going to work and people not everybody can afford all this stuff they left WLS that was an interesting thing because he was hired by Rook to WLS rookies and I talked about that and I told him that the baby was a handful but if he was willing to really work with him that he was worth it and Rooks didn't understand what a handful of I was trying to describe to him and he hired him that he was not prepared to put up with a lie and Crossways and then Bailey when he quit WLS in Chicago I'm going west and Brooke called him into the office and said they are waiting just came in congratulations you're number what is is good I can accept any came up to know walk you stay busy for a couple days and I don't think she had a job there's all kinds of stuff about wacky being responsible for him going to WLS and all that I don't know where that true or not but when he left there he did not have a job and I suspect he probably would have enjoyed coming back today with your tail out except if they would not have paid in the kind of money that he had been making in Chicago and I think I'll be waiting a while I tried to pay at least for a dual stage of the big 89 in Chicago once again John real estate in Chicago and taken just a little more Direction he probably would have been a major voice nationally like Oprah Winfrey many others who came out of the Chicago Market paid him a good dollar I don't remember what it was but it did was well over what he'd made Louisville button money it matter if he just a one-day walked into that said I'm leaving and that was about it a great talent and original and certainly you know the type of talent that you just always looked for someone who didn't sound like a disc jockey but he did not to conform well to Direction he was his own direct your head and tests tutored him well and was probably still is legendary still wanted to come back and we both thought wklo couldn't come close to the salary bill made in Chicago even adjusting it for a smaller market for a competitor whay either but they all look closer and soon Bill Bailey was back in the Derby City and wacky's morning drives like which has recently been vacated by skinny Bobby Harper here's wacky program director and former Chalo DJ Johnny Randolph is a Chicago but he was not happy I listen to chamonix are you just tell me what happy sad some conversations with a dabs up.

David Katz the Duke of Louisville and people think that's how he really was out he really is is that true well yes that is true but really different from that in a lot of people really don't know bill the bill was always very well-read I was always impressed by his knowledge of the Bible did he never wore this on his sleeve or anything but you just think I picked up over years working on the 10 years with it now. To this day I don't know his religious preference or his political leanings the back but there's an awful lot of integrity and I wanted to let Bill know how much it is meant to be personally and professionally and how many Greer's he is started how many people not just radio people but how many flippers really loved and respected guy over the years it has been years since he's been on the wagon and Kayla we should still have people still talk about and I want to build know just what an important marks an important footprint he is made in radio in Louisville you know when the whole thing was over with.

We didn't expect a 79-73 today we look for about 80 to and I'm sure they close tonight anyway it's 60° such a nice level you know I will never forget when I came to Louieville I wanted to hear what the competition sounds like so one morning I was listening to Bill Bailey who was the big day lowest I'm just waiting to be by anybody else but it was to meet I heard him say Well this kid just call me on the phone they told me that some guy is picking on him at school they want to know what he should do and I told you tell that guy that you know Bill Bailey has that doesn't scare him off run because he's probably crazy but other boys will be tough to beat this guy you know and I don't think we didn't really sound like sometimes be able to go out and he was to have a little bit too much to drink and he would call me and ask me to sit in for him you know which I didn't mind doing because people bringing breakfast every morning so I can do that I was going to be fed well if I did it go when I was at home and I got this call from Bill and he said soon as Bill Bailey but you believed I was in a car wreck and I need you to work for me in the morning and that is to Snellville I wouldn't believe that Jesus well would you please I had too much to drink I got the fight with a guy who is 6 ft 4 in a beat the hell out of me.
