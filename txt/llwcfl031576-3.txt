Lujack do not necessarily reflect those of wcfl its management or any animal mineral or vegetable either living or dead and now speaking to you from Chicago here is super Jack himself Larry Lujack thank you thank you very much you're here you're too kind my fellow Americans the title of this my last major address from this radio station is why you should keep listening to CFL and not pay any attention to what those silly rock and roll stations are saying and by the way reprints of this address will not be available so perhaps you will like to take notes now the next song you are going to hear will be the last rock and roll type song that you will hear on this radio station or at least until I become general manager which could be a day now but I know I've been saying that for years but it just doesn't seem to be happening I don't I just keep getting passed over when promotion time comes around I don't know what's wrong anyway after the next song that's at the end of an era before I get to the main business at hand here there's something I've got to do you've all heard the commercials that the other rock stations in town lsxrt d a i b p m FM. they're urging you to switch to their stations they're like vultures circling overhead as waiting for this moment and I promise that when this moment came I would make an endorsement and I'll just like the politicians to so all the managers in the program directors in the disc jockeys at all those other rock stations are listening now and they're really excited because they're thinking she that sure would be neat if Ole soup would endorse eyes and I'll be guys after all he is super Jack you know and he always will be other District he's come and go but super junk just keeps coming now this endorsement is for you people who just flat refused to listen to anything but trashy rock and roll I mean if you're that shall here's my endorsement may I have the envelope please and now he's going to Savage lyrics open the envelope well this is a surprise and this is going to come as a bitter disappointment to all of those stations taking our audience because it says you're on the card that mr. Lujack's coveted and much sought-after endorsement has gone to radio station k h j and how this this also poses a problem for you listeners to you see because unfortunately khj is a rock and roll station in Los Angeles and most of you do not have radios that are powerful enough to pick it up and the rock stations here aren't worth listening to it so now what do you do well I'll tell you what you should do you should just keep listening to CFL give up rock and roll for the following reasons number one you don't need it rock and roll is kind of like smoking you know you get addicted to it but you don't need it in fact it's not good for you scientific Studies have shown that in addition to loss of hearing too much rock and roll can stunt your growth cause irreparable brain damage make your teeth ache your nose bleed and in extreme cases can even make you sterile know what I'm talking about here I'll be honest with you I like rock and roll it's junk but I like it but I think the most people like a little of everything in music I mean I like Led Zeppelin and boogie fever and all those but I also like Moon River by Henry Mancini so if you think that perhaps you have reached a stage in your life where you've had enough scream and guitars and drag race and zip cream commercials to last you for the rest of your life hey just keep it on CFL and calm way down now I've heard the tapes at what we're going to be playing starting at 7 tonight and it's pretty stuff if you lock like songs like Aquarius which I do when the moon is in the seventh I think maybe I like it at least give it a shot and make sure that it's 7 tonight your radio is set on CFL and you'll find it very soothing and relaxing it will help you lighten the burden of reality Plus it is great music to make love to now let's see a show of hands out there in the audience how many of you would like to make love well hey if you like to make love you're going to love this radio station because that's the kind of music we're going to be playing now what's going to happen between now and 7 I can answer that question after this final song you're all you're going to hear for 2 hours is the sounds of the ocean from 5 until 7 this is kind of to get you in the mood you know and I suggest that you fill your tub with warm water take off all of your clothes and climb in the tub and just lay back and close your eyes and relax and pretend that you're laying on the White Sands of a beach near Montego Bay with the one you love and there is course one more reason why you should keep listening to CFL you see notice I'm not saying goodbye I asked cuz I ain't going nowhere I'm needed here and I got to be right here again tomorrow afternoon from 2 till 6 playing the most beautiful music that you have ever heard in your whole life if the good Lord's willing and the Creeks don't rise so I'll just say so long for now because lovers Never Say Goodbye and a lot less Rock Bumble & The Stingers and idiots when we were going steady take it easy take me out of my house if I don't know much about go back to take the purple satisfaction baby baby got a guy here she needs him a couple.
