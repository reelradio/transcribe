you know I have never I don't think as long as we've known each other and exact and I we work before in the other stations and probably will a gain on another station and I have never ever followed you and never realize that you've got something wrong with your hearing well if you got to crank it so you got to see my gray cells and synapses don't fire is like they used to be important and I'm telling you I never thought in my life that I would be honoured by a brewski brewski because as a salute to j.j. Jackson and the edge the last 2 hours are brought to you commercial free by our friends at Budweiser brand spanking new from the car is that not a brilliant piece of music and Michael biehn Scott music in the boys from the call is Brandy new not going to hear anywhere else in the city until next week the call with Let The Day begin great song in the last song that we played before we take it on out of here then I'll make sure you're paying close attention to the lyrics as well okay new from Bowie we can say we were and will be again the best in the west 101.9 19 I got to go out should always go out take a nap and take an ax Peter Gabriel Walk Through the Fire Fire Woman comes from the cop that's the New York City remix here on the edge and we've got our favorite lady how you doing it's really sad now you know it's actually amazing wheel I think yesterday and then that doesn't mean that we're still not tried today but it's just that overwhelmed with the the facts and the the letters in the calls and it's which one's been lit for 3 Days in the people have just been so supportive and Incredibly intelligent than one if we will written letters and fax things in it I just been completely blown away and because of all of that unless I think that it said quite possible we might rise again and hopefully in the near future you radio station has is meant to my career I'm I'm coming from Los Angeles having lived there for 48 years and hearing it in your words first and only station to play a drum for a long time cuz they were stupid and they were waiting for research you know they do focus groups they put them in and they play Like Music what you know if they had done that when Stairway to Heaven came out it never would have been if we don't do it that way and I know that that's where the people heard it and that's where the home and I'm a nation comes from it it's what they hear while we love you and we recognize any time when a person gets behind the microphone and they can make the little hairs in the back of your neck stand up in a little Goosebumps jump out of your arms and then that person got a lot of talent and if there's any way in hell that week in there and put that over there waiting on other people hear that and feel the same thing I mean that's the one thing is basically all we are is a conduit you know and that's what with a radio station that plays music should be as a conduit hopefully we've got good ears and I've got a staff that you two May Mays in yours and if we've got good ears and then we lay it out to the public then if it's a true product as yours is know if it's something true and a real art then they'll pick up on it and that's why you got up what you're working get close to being Platinum now aren't you know any success but at the same time that I just love you to do so down-to-earth and I we love you here play in town again in September if they're in La so probably like hell to make sure that we're up and running September cuz we can't wait we can't let some other radio station list of a common all the way from Tulsa to be late as hell back then alright we love you good luck to you and and you know let me tell you once again there's nothing like coming over Los Angeles call my woman is making love to you I want to hear I want to see you are you going no more from thank you good night the following Melissa Etheridge has the most welcome phone call from Tulsa Oklahoma we went into Melissa live with bring me some water but you did to live at the Roxy back in October it was broadcast on this very station and we were quite proud to do so and then we moved into you to live with the Maggie's Farm that's fine I will meet you can get in as Wreck-It stores that carry the hard to find things there's quite a few here in Los Angeles and I'm sure in Orange County as well they're checking its called live from Ireland and that big benefit concert at having a few years back you two new version of Dylan Maggie's Farm of course Bono coming on Rockets this is about working with the Irish band clinard in this one's very smooth very pretty 101.9 the last night before we fall off the edge surround. I'm looking for a piece. this band is called big and big son of course I sound very much like the place needless to say they were influence by the police this is what you got and if the entire album which we have yet to get an opposition since this is like a CD single it was sent to us a right away and then I guess the album will be released real soon the entire album is indicative of this particular continents going to be a good one to take him a long way the police in front of that the police not Sting the police with their version of I burn for you I stings version is quite different this version comes from the soundtrack of the film Brimstone and treacle now I'm talking about this only because of the fact that I've gotten an awful lot of Kudos and I appreciate that and it's wonderful but the clever things if I did any clever thing whatsoever it is a symbol right James a symbol a wonderful staff now the reason I say that is because when you've got music musicologist and you've musicologist on your staff and people who love their music as we all do then you get all this wonderful input so that was Randy Thomas that turned me on to that particular version of I burn for you. Just keep somebody on the phone that called up to Melissa called I ended up hanging up on her by mistake are you doing all right this is a nice surprise pillow wow no isn't is this this isn't him Willie I'm so glad I did when you were down here before and you did the show with Jim I was one of the most mesmerizing times I've ever heard on the radio and it was just I'm just flattered and just pleased that to you or come by this station for us in that as you did it just didn't seem like you had a really good time.
