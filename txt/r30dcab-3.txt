this is Jean weed back with our American Bandstand 30th anniversary celebration with our special guest Dick Clark I think I like young people better than older people the reason is very simple they're easier to talk to their more fun I like they're beating their easy to dance to at work Presence at 3 hour special introduce you to the 30th anniversary of American Bandstand I'm talking about rate a record I'm not sure he has an influence on the record Vine taste it's been there for 30 years now it started the first week of the show is never really changed one thing I deposited it never changes the things that kids say I like the beat and it's easy to dance toEarth Wind & Fire with a giant from last year Boogie Wonderland you know over the years the record Raiders on Bandstand rate a record it made their fair share of mistakes probably no mistake was as serious as this one somewhere along in the early sixties a friend of mine brought me a record he discovered that he'd brought it in from overseas and he showed it to me it had a picture jacket is over. I guess he had a picture of the group that was it I said looking people have played the record I said nothing new as far as I can figure out who has it on the thing the kids listen to the record and as I recall they they weren't overly enthusiastic they gave it a 73 which is sort of passing them so you know that really great and they start of snickered of the way they looked the song was called She Loves You by The Beatlesplay Incubushow do you sayin Terrariado you know you still The One That Got Away on write a record number one for the Beatles back in 1964 she loves you yeah yeah yeah decades now as our 30th Anniversary salute are American Bandstand 30th anniversary celebration rules on you learn to dance by watching American Bandstand most of us a local dance would become the rage the moment it was introduced on the show but how are those dances created every now and again somebody would come to the studio and say Here's a dance involving sneakers penny loafers their jeans or they would create a dance I see you don't understand doesn't happen that way but there was a time when a song was created around Advance happening in the studio kits were dancing to Chuck Willis records truck was the king of the stroll the diamonds had never heard of this troll until the day he visited what are the times if you remember we came to Philadelphia for Bandstand and you talk to us and turn a tour manager and you said the kids are doing a dance that they're calling the stroll but there's no song by that title there they're using old truck Rolling Stones cuz of the temple was right not to watch this there ought to be something that somebody could do with it and so we didn't watch the kids when it was great there's got to be a song called the stroll and what they did was run back to the drawing board and have a song created for them is a giant it for the time come how to turn around let's go can you find my hand 5 from 1958 the diamonds with the stroll just one of the countless dances spread throughout the land by American Bandstand but this surpasses everything else the first time ever saw the twist I looked over the corner of the studio when they were a couple of black kids doing this thing and I sidled up over to them later on at 11 as a man you don't let the twists and all I had done at that point was to call the camera man's attention to the fact that this could knock us off the air well in three days the whole studio is doing it and that it was probably the biggest dance craze since the walls that I've done that I've broadened my horizons I take my twist and now I know where every other dance and I'll turn myself into quite a number one for Chubby Checker in 1960 and again in 1962 The Twist don't leave the dance floor yet because we're going too fast forward end of the seventies and disco when our 30th Anniversary salute to American Bandstand continuous we're back with the American Bandstand 30th anniversary celebration with the Advent of the 1960 America's got on their feet and headed for the Go-Go joints and discotheques across the country but in the late sixties and early seventies and of course I would have turned when this go was born again in the mid-70s you know what's the strangest thing about the Disco everybody was in the dancing all ages of all ethnic backgrounds and economic background you would think that it show that had as its backbone dancing to records would have had an extraordinary rise in popularity disco had a big influence on the Bandstand but the ratings as always stayed the same I have a feeling that tomorrow if the World Turns The polkas the ratings will stay landscape Beyonce's mom MovieTube the woman everyone acknowledges she's now gone on to become an extremely versatile performer Donna Summer with last dance and now it's time for the Big E the question everyone wants answered can Dick Clark Dance have been as the numerous occasions do I dance and I always make a joke out of it no I don't dance it's more fun to leave it that way the truth is I can dance about as passionately as anybody else but I'm so terrified that having been around at all my life will people will look at musically that poor soul he's such a mediocre dancer from the Bee Gees Staying Alive we'll be right back with more advanced and memories when our 30th anniversary is Duluth returns call American Bandstand interesting Lee enough the pre Beatles 60s had their own Beatles and East Coast field never got enough respect musical person I know he knows everything about performing music publishing arranging writing distribution the financial end and he's had more hits I mean you know what said he is underrated look at the record look at the number of hit records they've had Frankie Valli alone and Frankie Valli and the Four Seasons first time we met was in 1962 and I was working in Point Pleasant New Jersey had a big hit record to Sherry and you invited us to do your show and one of your very first questions was do I talk the way I sing which at that particular time you know it was very funny and I my recollection is correct I answered you back in the high voice and then you really got a scream out of it that's really the first time why don't you come out I told you come out from Frankie Valli and the Four Seasons out of 1962 that's called Sherry you know it's funny then the later groups like The Rolling Stones but they were equally outrageous here's a Bruce Ballad of the four preps gift for making us feel at home and we we did about 20 Bandstand welcome Italy expected something a little more ostentatious we ended up changing our wardrobe in the secretary's office and I backed into a mimeograph machine and getting stains on my shorts you know but it was a fun thing a Bandstand was really kind of the Pinnacle of that first year for around them will be 45 in Long well play Runaround Sue Hangin permanently eliminate the games done more money for you and me let's send him up the river for about a thousand years the Belmonts are out on the parking lot stealing hubcaps off of car Rihanna one must never ask us we will tell by the four preps from 1961 on more money for you and me you know the Press weren't the only ones Playing Tricks on Dick Clark did Mother Nature there was a day when virtually no one showed up for American Bandstand was pretty funny these days here's the show that's totally dependent upon tuning in and washing 150 kids dance to records and a guy thing in here they are one day in the dead of winter in downtown Philadelphia we had the biggest blizzard of all time in the middle of a public transit strike three children showed up that day and you know that'll strike Terror in the heart of a man who looks out of his holy mackerel what do I do for an hour and a half Denny's and the fact that I Anne Marie's very first hit Snowbird will find out how American Bandstand met the challenges of the post beetles 60s when our 30th Anniversary salute continues hours of operation continues the ultimate establishment broadcasting Funny How Times change because I'm the second half of the many bands considered to be an establishment but is Dick Clark remembers not all groups felt that way. Of time in the 60s when it wasn't the fashionable thing to do to appear on a Bandstand show if you were of a you know a certain kind of artist but on the other hand the doors were on the show in this group straight in from San Francisco I remember it well with Gracie Slick and the Jefferson Airplane from The Summer of Love 1967 the Jefferson Airplane and somebody to love the long hair and bizarre outfits of many groups in the 60s obscure the fact that the musicians and most of those bands were truly outstanding for example John Sebastian of the Lovin Spoonful recalling his first appearance on Bandstand it was difficult to distinguish us because hey here is for long-haired guys with guitars and of course we were trying to somehow explain that that there was a little bit of a difference just in as much as it was very much an American Music phenomenon and and very much of a of a hybrid and in some ways and we were amazed at how few pressed people are of the time we're picking up on that music The Lovin Spoonful from 1965 and one of the great ones do you believe in magic what are the amazing things we've learned during these past three hours is the incredible array of musical knowledge possessed by Dick Clark a fact which also astonishes band stands producer Larry Klein he is so good that he makes it look easy and it's just the opposite is very difficult is everything you can about every group he knows what's going on when Dick introduces the next record he can look in that camera and say and coming up next is a group that had three gold records and and their fourth album is going golden album dick knows this stuff nobody Miss Carly Simon Nobody Does it Better we're back with our American Bandstand 30th anniversary celebration it's impossible as you know the cover all the artists and all the songs that it made the past 30 years of American Bandstand so memorable so if you haven't heard your favorite we apologize of course the world has gone through a lot of changes during the past 30 years but one thing remains is vital fresh and alive today as it was back in 1952 and that's American Bandstand doesn't get old as everything changes the music changes the people in all of that you know something that's a lie nothing ever changes that show is kids dancing to music that's the way it was a 1952 and that's the way it'll be till when can you teach me with him goodbye Rose McGowan remember will be the day that I die. I think I've said it before but it probably is this is what I really wish a lot of people claim to be the founding father of rock and roll I am not that I don't want that credit I don't think there was any one single founding father I would just like to be remembered as one of the men who assisted at the birth of rock and roll and today rock and roll is grown up cultural historians write about bands Dan's crucial role in bringing rock and roll into the American mainstream but let the experts worry over such things as that because today Bandstand is helping to write the future of popular music nowhere is that more clear than in the finale for The ABC television salute to American Bandstand 30th anniversary on Friday October 30th on one stage Dick Clark will have assembled a super group of musicians great players including the likes of Mick Fleetwood Charlie Daniels Billy Preston Mickey Gilley 24 Musical it's an all and in one of the greatest Jam sessions ever they will accompany a Vintage Film of the man who helped start it all rock around the clock 11 one of the reasons I'm so sentimental about the Bandstand is you don't usually have a job for most of your adult life this is become a part of my family apart of my way of life it's it's affected my life and I'll never be able to forget it some jobs you can forget it's become more than a job it's become a part of me this radio specialist eluding 30 years of American Bandstand was produced and directed by Frank furinno written by Alan Daniel Golba production coordinator Bill Cochran engineering Charles Bruce this is Jean weed thanks for being with us real radio.com
