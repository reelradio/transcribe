radio with the techniques that were in use at that time since then the techniques of changed News man in their modern and efficiently equipped vehicles are far more mobile they're able to cover great distances radio units the size of a small valise Communications has improved to a degree that broadcasters in 1938 would not have thought possible and these are the techniques that we have utilized in preparation of our presentation of the War of the Worlds radio production staff has follow the plot outline and Basics grip very closely we approached the story with the feeling of not how can we copy it but how would it be covered by a modern Newsroom in the day and night and you are about to hear the results are writing and production sad about date of the basic story and changed locations to make it more meaningful to our with the New York audienfor those of you that have heard the show in past you know what takes place on Grand Island those of you who heard the original broadcast you will find very little changed the story the sequence of events Remains the Same but those too young to have heard the original you are about to find out what all the planet was about radio in 1938 was a fledgling industry one that was beginning to discover its own impact on the audience of the War of the Worlds was a graphic demonstration of just how much impacted could have the broadcasting industry that time had a strange Charisma that surrounded it with a radio announcer said it was true then it was true the same could be said for newspaper people have since become more sophisticated more aware of what goes on about willing to accept all that they here on the air or read in the paper but put yourself in the position of a listener in 1938 and you'll begin to grasp the import of what occurredat the same time Halloween night 1968 WKBW radio brought to a close the most intensive promotional campaign that we'd ever run campaign directed at informing the public of Our intention

throughHalloween evening people call WKBW radio when is The War of the World going to start and we would tell them 11 and promptly at 11 to show began then we started to get call saying well where is

way the modern news Department would handle a developing story of this nature again we follow the original sequence of events exactly at Orson Welles did in the original broadcast we will interrupt the show a number of times to say this is a dramatization and in the midst of the horror and Chaos you will notice that we are not that chaotic we cannot interrupt for commercialall these things are

And now currently rampaging exactly why refinery in Pittsburgh machine sapera day moving toward the community of Bradford from all reports are moving rapidly emerging towns and communities as possible however they stopping to tear up our lines at Bridges and railroad tracks and punching huge holes in the in the highways ain't being objective is to Human Society altogether washing machine is reported to be moving toward the City of Erie Pennsylvania but they are perhaps attempting to link up with the machines that have landed in the Buffalo area further report from the Battle of Grand Island to bring you up-to-date that are they part of the Niagara River Army Field pieces destroyed access Bridget to the island people have been over the falls in an effort to get away from these machine the bridges were destroyed despite the fact that that little the population of the items after everyone seems to have fled the city and they are gone or they are dead from the gas or have been crushed they are coming closer now and heading toward me very close now I can't make it out it's getting garbled again they're getting ready the message is ended comes from a new Pi operator and Dunn Creek hold on just a moment where are you now City Hall very irritated old place is completely open. And his family and you and I are at the field. What's your status I hope my guys are all right and I'll I hope it's only a Communications problem I have you heard anything from at all nothing at all nothing at all. I'm thinking about Dad and I got to assume that the rest of the crew is gone two people are I desperately trying to think of the city I don't think they quite know where they hope to go information to the studio here I would have talked to the phones and all that has been very very sketchier but this point would you know that the the Grand Island Bridge has it both been blown in an effort to keep the Monster Machines on the island has landed there on the island but they were able to Ford the river we're going to just pull in this room all over the place I understand that chips off the west coast of the US have been diverted to Coastal ports in the Washington Oregon California to take refugees off they're abandoning abandoning Vault Angeles to San Francisco and there's been no sightings out there yet it seems it's only the East Coast has been hit but look down at all the main arteries of the city is I say they it's just one big mess traffic jam and had nothing is going anywhere at a guy's I just just standing still it's almost like looking down at one of these cities there's nothing moving that's all I can say about it I don't know what you mean we just received a report that a report a few minutes ago from Dunkirk switch from the top of the building you might be able to go to look at because he things are awfully high from dump truck is supposed to be a couple of machines there East Aurora has been abandoned and it's occupied as I understand it by martians and it looks like you guys are moving right now is frankly I was lucky to be able to get out here and get up here I hear something quite sure what it is I can hear the sound to her but we've been listening to it all night long and it's the machines will get additional all the confusion of the refugees are causing that they've been knocking off Communications with the does the one of the interesting things about this is the day that they haven't been knocking down houses that they can possibly avoid it I don't know what they're trying to accomplish more interested in Communications and that part will do something going on out of Lake what it is southern part of the area from here to City of Lackawanna is completely blacked out all the power in that area is knocked out only thing I can see are what appear to be explosions in the area of the Bethlehem Steel company plants do we've been getting very little here in the past few minutes so the communications were just in complete and utter chaos the teletype machines you can hear it behind me they're chattering away but they're not finding anything good just sitting there and just kind of rocking back and forth but not putting the phone why did almost impossible to keep up with it I was just given up answering them cuz if you have anything to do there I think I'm pretty much as they were except that now there is no sound at all everything is his just deathly quiet nothing is moving I told her that that that weird sound apparently emanating from the machines Germans are totally ineffective the airguard playing in the F-150 appears to be totally Circle by these machines and and they're ripping out the communications and punching huge holes in the major arteries in the road so it doesn't appear as though many people are able to move their automobiles in those are not able to move that car there a band it ain't got none of it is further adding to the congestion is there any movement below you is that you can notice absolutely no movement or whatever it had this is what puzzles me about the people would have gotten out of the car and tried to make it away on foot but absolutely absolutely nothing is moving there appears to be a gaseous kind of China material spreading out all over the car that I am not quite sure what it is or that's probably that's probably is gas in it and it's very very lethal gas and I was reported to the part where you said I had a Grand Island when they forded the river there all right I'll answer bought it and John are going to you want to be careful and say hi if you can cuz that stuff stays close to the ground what's the win-loss shut up I can see I can see they are trying to get in downtown area area of 8 on the Thruway yeah they both very rapidly Bo body and long legs I can look right now in Niagara Square are you there Billy very very careful now they've been after Communications all night that's what they've been destroying all the way down the line you're the Communication Center there for the county and that's it can you hear me can you hear me maybe you'd want to talk to who is there anybody else the only one left I want everybody's listening I want anybody's got a radio this operation go outside and smoke it won't go outside if this thing oh yeah hair feels good Boomtown I want to go to Blue Smoke Main Street movie coming out with my wife the smoke is smoke is obscuring but it's one of my case in just went out it's only about a block and a half away Einstein Roblox that's getting off the club. Eureka Street underwater the white lights are all going out the War of the Worlds it's over broadcast is over in the margins one or did they h.g. Wells did not quite end you story this way he closes by saying that Civilization as we know it was destroyed second selected humans were kept to breed a super race under highly controlled conditions by the Martians in to function as workers for them but the Martian having accomplish their purpose of disrupting civilization fell prey to the thing that we humans deal with day in and day out the common cold yes the Martians caught colds they were attacked by bacteria the mold form and having no resistance succumbed while scientific knowledge has opened new Vistas for mankind and yet tonight we presented a picture of complete and utter chaos it was play you won't do it but you must have been wondering what would I do if it would really happening think about it
