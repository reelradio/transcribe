reminded me about maybe seeing that explosives radio interview before it actually 65 why we do remember that particularly well because well Bruce and Rick were in the studio in the hotel I was back in the studio and we had a three-way conversation and during the course of that time Bruce thought it might be interesting to hang a microphone out the window and get some crowd reaction over 10,000 people young people out in the street and I remember that the thing that was most of the disturbing and most interesting was the fact that the police couldn't understand why all of a sudden the kids were singing along with a Jingles police didn't have transistor radio that they are like the kids did and this is the way it sounded. and why you're in such a great mood while a crowd is in such a
