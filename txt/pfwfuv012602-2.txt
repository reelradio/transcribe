people in town on mixed bag it is our first anniversary back at wfuv and I would like to devote the next solid hour of this pageant to the medium in which I have spent most of my adult life as it turns out that would be FM radio and I'd also like to dedicated to some of the people who have most dramatically affected my radio life you'll know who they are soon enough I hope this all means as much to you as it does to me it 90.7 wfuvas long asmy name is Roscoe of wnew-fm what I'm about to read is written by Pete Hamill and it's called the war it appeared as a column in the New York Post on August 28th this year I thought you read it because it says a lot about the effects of War my feeling is that the realizing the effects of War it probably the strongest deterrent to war confirmation of that I like to read you something before reading Pete Hamill so War as never before the essence of war is fine famine and pestilence they contribute to its outbreak they are among its weapons they become its consequences General Dwight D Eisenhower one of those late summer New York days when we all the girls are beautiful and all the men of life and dark afternoons the bones they will swarm talk about the Mets men headed for the park to play ball with children and appears you so long as you want me to taking off their shirts to spend a few sweet all is watching the budget slice up the rivers it was A Day Made for Small Wonders Roy Peterson Gerald Silverstein and Richard Dwyer here to celebrate them Roy Peterson Gerald Silverstein and Richard Doyle in a dead they died in the swamps in the muck of Vietnam and their blood is on our hands we have rather given up on stopping that Roar it has become some strange and terminal disease one that seems out of human control Pacific diplomats it in Paris Richard Nixon and his agents it in San Clemente at every week the best young people we all know a shift out of to die it is Richard Nixon's War now nobody seems to care Nixon got a lot of publicity by ordering 25,000 men home but there was little notice that I bet rate it would take 23 years for us to get out of Vietnam I'm near the moral outrage seems to have died in us the Green Berets get involved in a gangland-style murder and we read it as if it were a movie and not be active men from a democracy company a chicken bone weary the nerve shredded by Too Much Death in Florida refuse to move out and their action is treated as a one-day curiosity instead of one of the most damning judgment yet made about our fealty commitment already there are thirty-eight thousand young men bed hundreds of thousands were maimed and crippled men with steel and plastic where their bones ones were men with poisonous dreams in the dark of night men whose eyes will never see a flower in Spring men who will never play ball with their children at dusk because it takes arms and legs to do so who's young men will carry the infection of Vietnam across all the Summers of their lives Roy Peterson a private first class in the army we hear no brass bands of Seattle you will never log on the corner of East 17th Street and Avenue S in Brooklyn watching the girls go by or walking about the Met warrant officer Gerald Silverstein will not walk the Grand Concourse with his wife I already owe on a stretch of Summer saying who sells tickled by the rub of love specialist fourth class Richard or you will never hold the son in his arms or feel Wonder I have a beer with his friends and bite things them War is Over they had the worst Buck of all to be young and brave in a bad time and yet we owe them something we owe them the promise that no more of their friends will die it should be our duty to change all this around stop this slow and filthy dance on the killing ground and let our young men live out their lives it is a measure of how much Vietnam has corrupted our sensibilities and we seem unable to anymore to act on such promises the other night in Brooklyn I was drinking with some young man all of whom had survived Vietnam that one could think of anything he had done there which was sweet and honorable they hated the war when they were there they needed more now you can, generation just so much and these young men know now that they work on that the brave politicians have never had the guts to bring this war to an end Congressman Senator and employee of the defense department were sent to Vietnam its troops the war would be over tomorrow if Mendel Rivers had to carry an M16 up new lawn Mountain it wouldn't be so brave with his mouth we know how was the put together old men roomy with bitterness corruption and power. The wars young men fight them this time we have asked them to fight on the wrong side all allies are the most debased corrupt government in Southeast Asia a collection of blackmailers thugs and totalitarian they are fighting for the Integrity of their Swiss bank accounts when the war is over they will lie on the Riviera Roy Peterson Joe Silverstein and Richard Doria will not share their champagne when my brother John was there as an Airborne Medicare earlier this year I found himself searching the bodies of North Vietnamese soldiers who have been killed somewhere near Bunnell sign and the pockets of one of them he found the wallet the wallet contained pictures of the Dead Man's wife and children and the magazine photograph of John F Kennedy it was no way to find out why but I would certainly have preferred to talk for a few hours with that young North Vietnamese then with Melvin Laird but of course will never happen because like 38,000 of our brave children E2 was that where the armor of love and you close your heart and peace this is Roscoe peace ring ring name Atlanta sweetie I am essentially a night person I've never been able to get up in the morning I've never been good at Anythink early in the morning when I was a child my mother moved across the street from the school cuz I was late every day I still ate every day I I love to stay up late at night I like to read and watch like movies and things like that begin to think about the night time and what it meant to me in a certain mysticism and I thought about sex when you don't feel like you have a cold or gets worse at night if you worried about something it becomes more anxiety-producing in the middle of the night I just want to send that and I thought they must be a lot of people in this city that needs something to relate to in the middle of the night and if I could create some kind of them camaraderie a relationship between myself and the rest of the night people then it would be more than just music I probably felt that I was at a definite disadvantage I mean I was still smarting under under the phone calls like that that brought off the air which we went through a lot of in those days so I felt naturally like a second-class citizen anyone's fault aminova certainly no one at the station or any of the guys but just from a historical standpoint as a disc jockey so I felt it I just couldn't expect to come on this is Allison Steele the way the guys would end and expect the same Rapport I felt that I had an advantage as well as a disadvantage and that was that I could do things that maybe the guys couldn't or wouldn't so I thought about the fact that I love the night that I am a night person and that if I could create that mood and people would relate to it it would be a very intimate atmosphere and so I began to Bounce It Off people you know the the guys on the other side of the hall which the way we describe a.m. and one who shall renew remain nameless I said to him what you think of this idea and know the night-bird thing came about because of The Duality the night-bird the nocturnal bird the owl and a 66 guys were Teddy's and girls with birds so here I was the only bird among other guys what do you think of this idea no no no to the cleaning lady that was locked in the building somehow that really didn't knock me out and I said No thanks a lot and I went on to the next guy and everybody had some idea nobody like this night for a thing but it was just strong to me I just felt it was a natural so I said well I've got to find some way of of creating it so I sat down and I wrote a little piece and once I wrote the piece I realized I had to have some music now I went through that library next to and you know how big that room is must have twenty thousand albums albums to find a piece of music that I felt would create the mood I was looking for and I didn't find it and I went on vacation the 15th of December and I was at a friend's house late at night up about the Hollywood Hills and this particular person was into ethnic music and sitting there in the dark and that sound came on and I said that's it I need bats it that's my music and I took that record and I still have that original like I've never seen it before since it is Colombian religious music pre-columbian Temple Music recorded by a lady named Elizabeth Waldo now after the end of this the part I use it changes Tempo and it wouldn't no way relate to anything I'm doing but just that much if it was enough to set the mood so I wrote the piece and then I began to look for the kind of music that I felt would be an extension of the of the mood so this is what the first night sound like flutter of wings the shadow across the movie sounds of the night at the night bird spread their wings and Still Waters above the earth into another level of comprehension are we expecting Allison Steele the night bird until dawn 90.7 wfuv members supported public radio from Fordham University Richie Havens I'll use any excuse to play something from the mixed bag album in this case high flying bird for my friend the late Allison Steele before that we heard her tale of how the night bird was almost Hilda the cleaning lady who got locked in the building history turns on a dime doesn't it can you imagine that can you imagine what that would have been like we heard Tom Paxton before that and peace will come out of Roscoe's reading of a Pete Hamill column from the New York Post in the late 60s about war and the lessons that we can learn from it right up to this very second perhaps people

but it did happen it did exist those of you who lived it know it and will never forget it those of you who didn't live it can learn an awful lot about it from this wonderful Peace by singer-songwriter Mike agranov called The Sandman at 90.7 wfuv with a broadcast room to living tomb of cracked acoustic tiles and you're left alone with your microphone in your playlist in your dials and the hands of the studio clock past midnight creep towards one it's time to take the air once more and the graveyard shift begun the day shift to the engineers of all left hours ago they close the heavy soundproof door and set your board a glow to the first two records up settling your chair on the cap and snap the transmit switch and you're on the air there's magic in the radio enchantment to the Aether a power board of mind and brain and yet a part of neither a power to be reckoned not in kilowatts or Jules needs to let a single voice like half a million Souls when you work that graveyard shift from 1 a.m. to 5 you start to doubt that anyone's out there or live the Halls are lifeless the phone is dead and there's nothing quite so lonely is to call with kilowatts in reply I hear silence on me they usually stick the rookie chocks in a lonely grave yard slap with me I broadcast Nights by choice I like that shift a lot cuz when I get the loan Lisa's I do from time to time I recall the Sandman and spinal show of 1969 1960 radio is awful and it's best I grew up with Cousin Brucie and the Wolfman on the rest in between the fast talk and the height for the acne lotion jingle and station Race with sound effects babe maybe play a single but that was all there was back then and that was all we had a Nostalgia finds a way to sit the good from all the bad and so intertwined was radio with Vaughn scenes of my youth that is tinted with a Rosy Glow that overlays the truth summer parties the beach every High School date those midnight drive my dad's olds and studying till they are all movies in my memory and behind them I still hear The Beach Boys in The Beatles in the Motown oh so clear to the counter point of DJ hype and ads for rheingold beer but then in 67 FM burst upon the scene where once played only Boston bronze became a rock band dream between the Sparks commercials they play three songs in a row and album Cuts and Waves versions played in Stereo and gone with all the my limited brainless DJ chattering singing station breaks another floral fecal matter instead these guys with wit and charm told what they had to tell and spoke as if they thought that I might have some brains as well I got to know the wall by voice that summer and come fall and hung around the station till I came to know the wall Bill Clancy in the morning slide and Stacy Charlie West and the same name will he was different and apart from all the rest of the overnights he had a special style he was older than the other has been around awhile Segway different album Cuts in the stream-of-conscious run into team set live concert tapes for he made listing fun and then we must have known my name he always called the kid but he let me watch him work and it explain the things he did and it and what's the twice smacked me in the studio late at night and let me cue the tapes and Records up to my delight till I wandered back home bleary-eyed is it was getting life and as the record spun he sat and talked the day has gone by when radio was younger so is he so it died while round his lonely Kansas Farmhouse snowdrift blue and curled the radio with the Living Color window on the world he said there was magic in the radio and champ Into The Ether a power board of mind and brain and yet a part of neither a way to take you miles and years by means unknown to science but it's since become up jukebox nothing more than an appliance I can tell you got the itch kid they'd like to be a jock give it up the magic is gone there's nothing left but it's locked you deal with all the crazies in the drugged-out suicide calls in the sponsors the SEC got you by the throat and programming tells you what to play and they take no denial a copy advertising crap you'd never think of buying the hours along the pay is squat vacations the Cottonwood Inn Eddie's face the mic and weave magic once again well sure enough he read me right I guess he could recognize a little of his own Obsession shining from my eyes and when I left for school that fall and higher education my first thought was to make a beeline for the radio station throughout my freshman year I learned the ropes and paid my dues I Engineers did commercials swept read the news by the time I was a sophomore I turned a weekly show I was on the graveyard shift but I was on the radio and I learned pool Sandman was a name that every DJ knew the trade rags to the story you got a piece of news week too and sometimes playing album sides from my desire to stay the night to end his show in my headphones just for inspiration and so it was a New Year's Eve of 1969 school was out they'd all gone home the station was online with day-old pizza pie and coffee by the quart they had me working triple shift from 8 p.m. to 8 playing records no one listen to while partying till late and CBS and hooked lines across the country to Times Square and at midnight we switch over to a live broadcast from there to hear the famous Ball come down and ring in the New Year my 11 tainted. So did you just could not believe who the hell is listening to the radio on New Year's Eve so I queued up Tommy that would kill half an hour or so kicked off my shoes plugged in my phone's turned in the sand dance show a different something's wrong I knew right off the bat he's playing straight top 40 his voice to sounding flat there's that are between is cut two spots on 12 Long inside of 15 minutes I knew something there was wrong I let him start a record dialed up his private line he answered with his call letters I replied with mine well hi a kid they tell me it's got a better way to spend your New Year's Eve and with some busted down DJ techno I'm on the year myself I got lots of time I do listen to your show cuz it's better far than mine but but tell me Sam and what's with you is everything alright seems to me as if you someone off your stride tonight everything is not all right he answered with a friend the Arbitron report came out and our ratings have gone down and and then Harry Stein and programming the term of that the way to get the ratings back on top is dictate what I play so here I sit with listed hand that says at 10:15 I should play the Righteous Brothers followed by the cream and then a Public Service Podcast and then some Moby grape well they do need a DJ to go put this crap on tape it's December 31st the year is coming to an end and with it ends the decade and an era to my friend and in 27 minutes I'll switch off to Times Square but when I returned in 70 you two dated if you care to hear how good the radio could be if it would dare he broke off at that moment cue up another platter and I said goodbye the who are almost finished for that matter but exactly twenty-seven minutes later more or less on Q I flipped the switch to hook us in with CBS and while thousands of New York bed fun farewell to 69 and Guy Lombardo and his orchestra played Auld Lang Syne I raise my slice of pizza and to lose to the new year erase board to the Sandman at the end of his career when a network show is over with I went back on Mike I did some inane comment about the future in the like to the station break cue to record up and then plug my headphones in and tune the Sandman and again welcome he began the 1970 radio you've noticed in the past a certain Miss to this show seems Harry Styles with Herman what your music taste should be Twista Harris time bfcc I've had my fill of radio host this year's my final hour but the door is locked and bolted and I'm on internal power and and I suppose you'll find a way to get me out of benchley but until then you'll see how good the radio could be and then the music started as a magic came on strong and how the sequence brought to light a hidden meaning to each song and where we got those tapes and record I'll never know old favorites I'd forgotten live recording some some show you can get anything you want at Alice's Restaurant what you want flowers singing German Dixieland on 78 Benny Goodman Walter Carlos Bessie Smith the roommate this is more than playing record this is art you know this is something all should hear damn I'll do my part I open the equipment cart and stowed beneath the board and rummage through the junk there till I find a proper cord patch headphone out to preamp in adjust the input power and the Sandman show gets relayed out through our antenna tower I reach out to the telephone dial wbba to Sansa there by Sharon Smith there overnight. H-hey Sharon pulse have you ever heard and there's a Brotherhood among the radio voices of the night they stand behind the fellow shot this season the fight Sharon adolescent but a moment I would have gone to find a patch and then the phone's that long I thought we're dead began to life as the calls came in from miles around from listeners the night whence comes this wondrous music they would ask and I always smile when I pick it up on every station of the dial and through the night the signal spread from station on the station as a DJ set the Sandman is Magic cross the nation toll Sharon called me someone put the CNN on the network wire that's why I flipped the switch to listening and laughed until I cried this and they must have reached hero New York engineer who put them on the wire for the whole damn world to here it was magic in the air that night enchantments in The Ether Power Board of craft and pride is so much more than either and all across the countries that the overnight hardcore and share the same man smashing till it's 4:20 he's stopped to say goodbye as they were breaking down the door New Year's Day. Cold and gray was just a touch of sleep and then he dropped by nine found himself on the street may I I came off cheap a reprimand was all I got that New Year's night the new voice broadcast from the Sandman slide and since that night the radios become my occupation are now a big shot DJ to Major FM station I want the hours start to drag and the nights going slow I queue up an album side crank up my headphone stereo in TuneIn to the Sandman now I'm Public Radio and when the broadcast rooms a living tomb of cracked acoustic tiles in your left alone with your microphone in your playlist in your dials do the airwaves Seema a graveyard of lifeless White & Boom there's always someone that's naked and you're really not alone king crab around around are you what is pressure you're not the best dancer avocado, Springfield 90.7 wfuv member support at public radio from Fordham University Ray Davies net around the dial from give the people what they want Mike aggrenox Brilliance Ballad of a sandman before that we will continue in this vein right after these words hi this is John Sunday breakfast serves up a bunch of Blues as we salute the Great Chicago blues Man Willie Dixon show me the music of the California songwriter Kate Wolf show me Sunday from 8 to 11 on wfuv Houston here with some big news to Billy Bragg's new album England half English won't be released in the US until March but we've got him here in New York for an exclusive Live members concert broadcast from the Fordham University campus we won't be making any other local stops until after the albums released but you can hear Billy Bragg still allow Thursday night January 31st at 8 right here at 90.7 FM wsqv and online at wfuv.org thank you Rita Patel back with you on mixed bag our first anniversary program back at wfuv and you may have detected some lingering anger and bitterness on my part about the untimely death of progressive rock FM at the hands of the suits and bean counters you know originally I was going to use this program as an excuse to rant and Rave about the about some of the bastards dirtbags and pond scum that I've had to work for over the years that I work with but I'm not going to do that it occurred to me that you would think less of me if I did and worse yet I would think less of myself so no names will be named tonight no incidents will be recalled of that help I will hold my tongue accordingly also and this is important someone that I trust and respect and love a great deal made me see that there is an equal and opposite parts and view about all of this stuff on the business side so I will respect that as well but that doesn't stop me from having my own very strong opinions about these matters and as luck would have it I was captive on an Amtrak train last Saturday. snow storm coming up from Washington back to New York and in the current issue of arrive which I guess is the Amtrak magazine that you find stuffed in that little mashup mesh compartment in front of you there's an incredible article about the satellite radio that's that new phenomenon where you have to pay for a receiver and I also pay a monthly fee to get out of hundreds of different kinds of channels of radio into entertainment into your home without commercial interruption in in most instances so I'm going to share a bit of the wisdom from this article by Buzz McClain with you right now Kevin I'm going to do this live all right and then we'll go right into well into the CD I gave you basically the article says that most of the country's 12,000 terrestrial radio stations broadcast one of a small assortment of formats album Rock alternative adult contemporary talk urban country and they fill the air time between songs and DJ banter with up to 21 minutes of advertisements per hour. The 21 minutes folks more than a third changes in Federal Regulations have made it possible for big conglomerates to gobble up several stations within the same Market consequently the 17 billion dollar radio industry has Consolidated in the last decade to the point where a small number of large companies own the majority of the Nations radio stations and to those bottom line oriented publicly traded companies what works in one market that is whatever sells advertising and a track rating will likely work in another so formats are duplicated across the country is in the Airways from one city to the next the names of the on-air personalities may change but whether you like them or not those same six formats very very little from sea to shining sea the result MEC radio for the masses I was seriously thinking about it. better listen to the radio I want to bite the hand that feeds you want to fight that handsome family. Publix hours Interstate at the car dealership if you only play the song list hey. Can you tell me what the song is what is the ecology wants to change later but before you leave goodbye. man that is terrific from Mark germino and the Sluggers it's called Rex Bob Lowenstein I don't know if it's a true story or not but it's certainly evokes exactly what we've been talking about this last half-hour and I thank him for it Rush before that with Spirit of the radio Darren called in to say that that might be the First Time Rush was played on wfuv in quite a long long time isn't that interesting and we began the set with Elvis Costello I was not a big fan of Elvis Costello in the early days but I have the Tiger has changed his stripes then probably largely because of that song radio radio by Elvis Costello This is 90.7 FM and wfuv.org members supported wfuv New York public radio from Fordham University
