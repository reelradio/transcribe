Now remastered on CD for 2007 along with the rest of the band's catalog Studio albums with their enduring popularity is kind of hard to believe the back in 1966 rather than have their pick of the litter the doors actually had to fight to get a record deal we have one offer from a picture of Records no one else in Los Angeles would sign the doors Capital would not even I couldn't even get in to Capital see anybody RC a couple of other smaller record companies that had the biggest Eve of Destruction or the hell does a dunghill they didn't want us and nobody wanted is Columbia at least took a chance on us gave us no money no nothing no recording nothing signed us for 6 months and the dropped us and we were on the drop list and the only thing we got out of them we did get the Vox Continental or against they had just bought box and Billy James God bless them said listen you guys need anything and we said yeah we need money right across from the Budweiser plant and pick out anything you want and I said Fox the fox Continental Oregon Dave Clark Five Eric Burdon and the Animals all the British Invasion bands that had an organ that was the portable Oregon that they all had so I was going to play Abby's freeway the hell to bake you can't haul around to be so afraid you couldn't afford to buy a P3 and then you couldn't haul it around so we went out there I got that box Continental Oregon and that was all they had to do a man that was a door sound put that piano bass on top of it big flat top and the whole thing is a Coachman do you know didn't really give us a very good deal but the three records was fine so what the hell is go do it after like my fire was a hit we got a new lawyer young Hotshot lawyer who went to jail Postman and said to give their publishing back you can keep the publishing you can't do 5% of 90 start upping the royalty rate and so you know we got it we got into a much better situation The Beatles I found out later on has the same kind of stinky deal they had a 5% deal to 5% of 90 in or they took off 10% to give the to the radio stations so you know I didn't feel so bad about it we had a rotten deal just like the Beatles did but hey who's complaining now so much to say to you come on baby Light My Fire which animal is it The Doors Light My Fire Wood unit edited formal become the band's first number one hit single it also gave the band Bitter grief when they performed it on The Ed Sullivan Show in 1967 Ray manzarek remembers the guy and he said the boys we've got a problem and I thought the show the problem is that we're running over and you guys can just go back home to California damn we don't get to do the Ed Sullivan Show but it wasn't that he just said network has come down and said you cannot use the word higher on national television and we did it anyway I took the full responsibility in this guy comes back because I told him okay okay we'll come back and says you said you were going to say the word higher and you said and you said so I go teenage mode and raise my voice in Ogden or we were so nervous we were on national television it was he had Sullivan Show and we've done it this way a thousand times and and and and and it just came out and he looked at me and I don't believe in yourself even really like you he want to do boys on for six more shows you know what that would have meant to your
