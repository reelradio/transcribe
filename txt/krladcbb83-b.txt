there's a lot more of the Beach Boys story Left To Tell the before we move on I got to thinking about all of the people with whom Brian Wilson is written songs and I decided to put Brian on the favorite collaborator is my favorite collaborator he and I we we know each other we know each other Style with lyric writing it is is basically what mic does and basically what I do is I write The Melodies and the courts if you give me an example of one of the best songs the two of you ever worked on together of all the songs that my club and I ever wrote together I thought do it again was was the most surfaced simple direct to the point song we've ever done and I'm very proud of itstation near meBruce Johnston offers proof positive of their non-stop power to pull in an audience on the 4th of July 1980 we played a half million people in Washington DC and that's probably the most mind-boggling thing that I ever did with the band you know one of the reasons why the Beach Boys are so popular in concert I guess a little trick they learned along the way and I asked Brian Wilson above the main thing is close to what you did but the background than instruments the drums you can never get it rightto the idea holiday Sonia California Gurls or any one of the other giant hits fifteen hundred times how do you get up to give a performance to an audience knowing that you've done it before so many times Well when you see the crowd response to the beach boys get then you know the answer it's spontaneous is Joyce happiness it's all kinds of good things I'll tell you one thing nothing can duplicate that kind of high but we will tell you how the Beach Boys managed to duplicate some rather Unique Sounds in the studio when our holiday tribute continue Dick Clark Roddy and complexity over the years from simple surf Tunes who many masterpieces now exhibit is the song that hit the top 10 around Christmas time after 6 it's sort of fast forward 37 Wilson of The Beach Boys that found a way to go beyond science how did they do it this is before the synthesizer invented way he would not touch them to do one of those Contraptions sounded like do you like wild Hunt dr. Hoffman's magic theremin from 1967 and Wild Honey by The Beach Boys could have remained on the frontiers of electronic Fantasyland but instead they decided to get home or natural my club explained you know in the days around the time we did good vibrations and heroes and villains there was an album we were working on called to smile and it was the Psychedelic era and then and that psychedelic era it didn't mean to stir the you had to be you know a completely whacked out on drugs but what did mean is you were crossing boundaries in terms of creativity and to do that you have to stretch you have to use your imagination but we do if we'd saying lying on our backs on the floor over their feet out put their heads towards a microphone up above and then did to get another affect we go into the bottom of the empty swimming pool and singing is like in a locker room at school there's an echo Factor Wellness going for another fact Barbie food poisoning Road in Monroe kill the some stories in the world of rock and roll that I hate the report especially when they concerned friends of mine like the Beach Boys so you know I'm facing tough times that sort of thing it's no secret that from time to time Dennis has been dissatisfied Carl is gonna separate way into the Beach Boys decided to do new material that has Mike love lovingly admits it's Brian who's had to face the most ominous villains and who's giving the group their finest moments in some of their biggest disappointments the most disappointing thing to me is to see the destruction of a personality by drugs on on Brian that was a bit by the most hurtful to hell yeah ruin it how did you put him in his room for 45 years you know I mean that not in his room is literally but basically out of touch with reality and out of touch with his are how did you handle it as a friend did you advise them talk to him about it because I have nothing to do with that kind of culture and I don't dig people coming around and laying things on people not good for them and it's probably better I wasn't around cuz I was Thrones people that windows and stuff cuz I'm half Wilson I Can Be Rowdy to you know how you know they're always continuing stories about Brian he's dropped out he's run away to Hawaii he's returned to California he stopped smoking you stop using drugs he's back on the scene he's not on the scene it's a little hard to keep track of for the most part I think Brian is back and I asked him if it's going down all these years I stopped traveling 55 and then I went for a few years and then I finally got back just recently why did you return I wanted to be with my brothers and cousins you know I wanted to be with them I just wanted to be with them now you genuinely like being in front of an audience my impression is that you just to not be there play no there are many relationships that last 20 years little hard to think of a friend you've had for two decades but the series around explaining their longevity and I asked my glove for of his theory I didn't grade dick you're on the love of my there a few reasons I mean there's a lot of reasons for each individual imagine but first of all we've known each other for years we've grown up together so we have a little bit of understanding and passion for each other second of all we love music and on a personal level just practicing TM you know how to trance do meditation stuff meditating twice a day cools out the stresses and I'm able to cope with the different personalities in the business ups and downs and so on so forth when I'm sure meditation is certainly help Mike love to stay together with the Beach Boys we're not going to take it good timing for the Beach Boys know of a factor in keeping the beach boys together with Brian Wilson feels that he needs a lot more than just music I have a lot of lives I have nine lives and no I don't I have the music the life I have a social life I have religious life it's it's kind of a private to Sky experience a lot of religious thoughts and religious beliefs dinner alone and you consider yourself to be a well-rounded and happy person I do I really do goliath grouper what I can we're talking about that elusive something that's kept the beach boys together for so long and I got a feeling that Carl Wilson really put his finger on it with his answer well I think the Beach Boys represented a picture of California picture of of ourselves I mean of of our country and our people if I take we were picture of that and it in a very sort of on vacation having a real good time kind of way the Beach Boys just left in the feeling flow recall garage lights off 1966 and 1966 Brian Wilson of The Beach Boys true classic I'm most proud of a Good Vibrations because it's it exemplifies a whole era I mean it's a whole involve piece of music that exemplifies it it says something was good reason Brian Wilson should be proud of the song and that his brother Carl shares that pride and with very good reason he sang Good Vibrations is probably one of the I don't know what you could what kind of record, but it was a real at that point in time I think the record was very kind of open people up I mean the people who are making music I think our our contribution a lot of ways was a thing we're kind of spread to other people that made music and for Beach Boys Bruce Johnston that song representative or a big gamble I think when we heard Good Vibrations finally edited next our signatures and added together we thought we were either going to have the biggest hit in the world or the career was over I mean is one of those records felt it was one of those records because we were well into the mid-sixties and by that time I think it was time for somebody to do something that then it had a little message to let you know and we put together good vibrations in a very odd manner it's used we utilize something like 5 or 6 Studios to to put something together re-recorded so sorry and I'm picking up cuz I'll be that was recorded at Columbia so weak in those days what did the single record normally cost to produce the punchline what did Good Vibrations car has cost about $15,000 revision stop please girl names with l Recreation Royal boys only improves with age from 1966 The Beach Boys in Good Vibrations that's still one of my all-time favorite so I can listen to that one a lot. Our holiday salute to the Beach Boys sum up a 3-hour special on the Beach Boys much less of a musical career spanning something quarter of a century the truth is I guess you don't seem possible almost anything I could say would sound like if the music is made our summers memorable certainly they brought the California Dreams of the world they've been hands the art of recording little something to dream about. I would love to if I may yield here to Mike love who sits in his hot tub on a cliff in Santa Barbara overlooking the Pacific Ocean and puts it all into perspective people sometimes think that maybe the Beach Boys are all running around the Woody together and they're not but we also have five and with Bruce sticks distinctly different life completely different each one of us but I guess in that diversity there is a lot of strength to because everybody brings a different point of view what is the future of old boy be doing this if you want to for another 20 years well the how is pacing yourself we've learned to Pace ourselves over the years we limit our tours to maybe 10 days to weeks maximum that we are attitudes and her body is physiological for fresh we're not pouring out when you get tired you get grouchy and irritable you have arguments sometimes our terminal with us we pay ourselves well probably yes although I don't think we'll ever leave our Roots behind because they're just too strong to hold boxer beagle mix black YouTuber rap. 1307 Linden Avenue anyways Kohl's play the kids are my kids names stop Supply in Canada live and die and I driving what do you mean radio
