Because we got nothing but good music to entertain you with right. That's what I drove across the Bay Bridge coming in from the airport last night was about a quarter to 12 midnight and it was amazing I don't remember ever going through women like that like we did last night we were on this cab and we were heading into town but we would go across all lanes and their big hurricaneslike I like I like a snake marching along to get it back in those days and the stories of Michael Spears are kind of legend of the big 6:10 I remember one time I decided I play Heartbreak Hotel was not a good thing for you to do everything on the list so I did I said Michael it's his birthday this is back in his lifetime of course so he said well why didn't you ask me and I said Mike was afraid you'd say no which proves that it is much better but when you're doing the radio show to ask for forgivenessback-to-back World War Champs just what's happening in the last 20 years in Lake Tahoe back with the all those days but she wasMarcyplay check every song gets better and better and better have you got an ounce or let anyone know is this the first were going to find out what the number one song is you know what they wouldn't tell me why because it's only goes down to 522. I have a secret I have photos I have negatives that gave me I know what the number one song is arriving here on the scene early in the 1974 and everybody was really pumped up because it gave us an incredible lineup I absolutely because it was probably and I say this with a great deal of Pride of the finest radio lineups of all timemorning man I remember that programs that's right so following you we had John mcclenning John Mac Flanagan from 9 to do and I used to tell Irish jokes about John and I and to be hired by Sebastian you had to have been the right astrological sign and and you had to be lined up correctly in the key a Moe's around here and Bobby I never could understand what he was talking about but warm and sincere and beautiful individual America's favorite disc jockeydo that tell when I came to titles like America's favorite diss track if you want something done right you do it yourself that's right why didn't like our industry trade magazines or something anyway deserve to that think about that engineer who was your first year and we were on the same wavelength radio in this market including the morning shift but I always thought he was a greatHigh School sports all of the teams who was big and strong and it was great. Just for his own show he had so much material that he finally sat down and said I can make some money with this and he put together an information pamphlet ft the game on a weekly basis that are just information and he was very successful be working on this nobody would he does not have anymore but it's still going I'm not using his information I'm sure as well he always used his jokes over and over to it so I don't know why thathas a guy who is still dancing John of course. I'm follows me now he's gone from 10 until 3 on the big 6:10 they let him out at night times now but that's right yeah he's back working at daytime shift good man and then there was a lady on a knife that was absolutely incredible in the morning and she'd give me a great big hug and kiss ever won a big hug when she came in they brought her in during my show so that she can kind of get an idea what was going onof all places and then eventually she found them loved and left the Bay Area to marry a guy that lived in the Los Angeles area and she still down there working at KLOS radio on fact you know what I haven't talked to her for a long time call is good for your pipes tojfrc takes you cruising into our nextera how you can get in the driver's seat to Tails Tuesday on 610 Golden Girls dropout call Mom number 5 this sounds like a rose Byrd production in the morning I'd come in and get a great big hug and a great big kiss from Shawna and all of a sudden that's just like the Good Ol days are you I am fine.

favorite City by 6:50 and 7:50 I want to see somebody who works for another radio station convention and we were all over and you about how everybody coming in and ordering so pretty soon everybody was gone here comes the waitress with a $42 bar tab and that was back when I didn't have 42 blacks and she said that yours you're Bart and I said well she said food not look around nobody was here so you were the one that stayed out of this because I told the story a hundred times and you had it coming coming up and before you play Elton John we got a great story will get to that adjust tomorrow at 7:44 at 6:10 kfrc Quicksilver winning is a feeling you'll never lose to the TV television with remote control and swivel base save 25% on Junior spring fashions women's pumps and bags sour note in ham steaks with water rapids and don't forget the delicious sliced ham you remember and she came and we were told on my radio program on that next afternoon and we call it the DJ now this was a big deal cuz of course EJ still being a big guys if it is and then he was so huge that that he would be on the truck fuel show Ryan following day and then it was CD so low there was nobody there programming for RKO is in town and he said no we had to explain it to people because we're always been very open about what went on and on the other hand we weren't sure we weren't even sure at that point if it was simply delayed or what the situation was and then I think we found out and then go on and say it but but I did it then then then they said he had that he had food poisoning right well then the next day because he was in town I would do it the next day via telephone was in his hotel room and I did talk with him for a couple of hours so we at least stay late to do that to you once and you wanted to buy tickets from me and the price was never a low enough and you got a free Elton John when the top 6:10 at kfrc 100 story proud of you what is this look what you doing Bubble Ball right now but everybody knows that was you hungry cannibals about to eat us or our car is parked in his spot are Reese's Peanut Butter Cups Reese's Peanut Butter Cups ever wonder why you get more for your money if you're lucky Food Center there are two big reasons everyday low prices and he buys everyday low prices means that he always has low prices throughout the other stores give you a few sale items and have higher prices overall lucky has lower prices overall on twenty thousand times so you can see why your total is lower the checks that I tried to change his name Rose it was myself marvelous I was wrong I all right that was probably his worst decision since the game shows but that's another backyard but even 70 years ago before all the air show preparation room and I use that term loosely because it was back in the warehouse section of the old Studios do yeah and I remember I can see these images of things that happened for whatever reason Mark working on his show and you're right I forgot about that part when Mike brought us through that's when I first met Mark he's all messed up all of the musical knowledge he had but you know every football team in town and who is the star of what team in the whole thing I learned that from a guy you used to work with in Philadelphia George Michael George Michael Sports 17 high schools or so in the Bay Area in the world and I still think that is your Prime Time 6 to 10 p.m. when he comes on here or until we hear Brandy which I know is the countdown whichever comes first in early 74 was not on a franc are cross and today my guys who did the morning show before I came and they moved him from Morgan Drive is very good huh history of the last 20 years Grande weather from 6:10 kfrc top 10 Countdown continues Domino's these are too big a mess and if you just joined us if you been out of the known universe for a while, Farsi just about everything and if I don't know earlier that I think so I guess Shawna was on all night so I had mucho Morales but I think you guys were right I think it was I think we shall tell me about those. you look forward to it more than she did as well as a matter of fact I got to go up to at North Beach to Enrico's and they had some of the clubs up there so we had some great times but I'm going to tell you I do John Valenti sunshine and everybody and she and I took it into the studio to her when she was on the air and she just flipped she just became orgasmic and every night for the next month so you have this picture in front of her when she did her show was just disgusting and she was going to transfer station down there as a whisker way to La you know if they going to let me take you away from all this stuff isn't that a picture of John we were competitors for a while you did the morning that program and what happened after that we were supposed to be the morning. About four days before we are going to sign that's right around the area he went Zippo and went to Dallas I think so they said can you please do this okay but it was it was an interesting experience I did that for about a year and then I had an opportunity for a management position in Kansas City so that's where I am now unfortunately working for my future is here anytime believe me thank you whoever Z sometimes does but he's been leaving is pretty much alone but he said program next song dr. I think it was either before or after my success I was 7 years old right now
