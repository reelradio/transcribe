well hello there done this is Julian bringing its the 10th day of April and last night I dug through a bunch of I wadc stuff from the time when I was there and I have a few things at all share with you now you have to get my my perspective on WABC is an inside or was relatively short is about three and a half years between February of 1968 and August of 1971 I came out a little radio station in New Jersey so that I had no big-time radio experience when I came to the station of course I've been 4 years and I remained an observer but all of the stuff that you're going to hear was put together prior or I should say when I was there this is these are things that I saved because I thought they were interesting by the first one is one of the more important things I think I ever did there it was done very early on I have been a mid-sixties Fuki and I'd really enjoy the song that Jesse Colin Young did with the youngbloods called get together when I got to the station I was in charge of a producing Public Service Announcement and a big premium was put on winning Awards various kinds really put a lot of energy Studio 2 the end so I took this Jesse Colin Young song which should have been released at this as a single at one point or another in a disability dropped out of sight in the mid-sixties took it off the album and with a technician and now the Seas to buy the name of Klaus Gruber was probably the best tape editor I've ever work with he was just a phenomenal a fellow with a razor blade hand with me and chopping the song down and it was 62nd and a 30-second bed and from that it was a little bit copy in the 30 second version I'm Dan Ingram and this is a message about Brotherhood brother interesting thing was that song I rather that Pasa was done in March 8th what a whole passel of the Brotherhood award in the National Conference of Christians in which I still have somewhere but it also did a lot of good for the youngbloods because even though get-together was originally released in 1967 and failed it only got up the number 62 on the Billboard Chart it was re-released in the in June of 69 after the spotted been on the air for a while both locally in New York and nationally and got the number five on the Billboard Chart lasting 17 weeks and I'm looking at this as the theme for the National Conference of Christians and Jews an accident in many respects it 28 w ABC is as a production wizard there's also another Institution the super hits survey a promo in which Ingram has innocence would announce the names of various artists small portions of their songs would be played as sort of a survey what the top hits were the day I guess subsequent research has proved that people get pissed off and you do that but I guess we didn't know that then he did a version for fun never appeared on the air this is one of them since 1968 was a presidential election year you will hear. Arrow fastener George Romney Hubert Humphrey and all my troubles cards wallet Nelson Rockefeller Ronald Reagan music Power Radio is it a legal notice something strange about the virtually every one of these PSAs that was done for a broadcast the jock identifies himself in each and every one of them with her it wasn't anybody else promos under the actor rules have to pay the jock extra Ingram had a deal where he was the production voice we paid them extra anyway but we didn't want to use up that kind of thing on PS you'll hear the jock self is by far the best technician as an announcer I have ever worked with by far there's no one even close just text me I would have played for you is a TSA for the New York City Department of Sanitation that was done in exactly one take one take the way I am I usually work with this kind of thing was I created the bed so that the Bedtime out properly and then wrote the copy to the bed because of that effectively everything was done on full track was that we roll the bed and Inglewood talk over the bed on my Q's anyway this one worked out perfectly in one take it's a piece of copy he read absolutely wants and never ever again you have an old car if it ever breaks down you'll have to jump it but in the meantime it runs and get to where you're going until one day it just. What do you do then I'll do the Bandit on the street call the New York City Sanitation Department at 9 6 4 1 800 tell tell the car away for you free high-end dining room remember to get rid of your old unwanted car call the sanitation department at 9641 804 free tow away service call anytime 24 hours a day 9 6 4 1 800 so much for my 1968 archive 69 a copy of the WABC airchecks of the great blackout of 1965 November 1965 that blacked out the entire Northeast the afternoon just after 5 I think if I have this right and the audio for WABC at that time was continuously recorded on a device called a scriber which used rolls of used video tape is wide and scan the audio across it so that tape would record 24 hours worth of audio is that a private at the recordings were very good but this is what it sounded like on WABC November 1965 When the Lights Went Out Glenn is running slowly that's a very lazy Riverside been disbanded the electricity is falling down lazy river in the key of r the 1969 was a big year of landing on the moon and Rick made a contest out of it and you can be there watz radio will fly you and your family to Florida to see the blast off for the first man landing on the moon women strip right under postcard the first sentence you think should be spoken by the first man as he sets foot on the moon areas will be crowded and if there's a hold you may be down there for a few days we'll do our best to get you off from work or school if you win can't go will give you $1,000 win this incredible prize right on a postcard the first sentence you think should be spoken by the first man as he set foot on the moon and mail it to the Moon doesn't I had control of the public service announcements on WABC within reason I can do some interesting things with them one of the favorite things that I like to do was to take a national campaign usually sponsored by the the what was called the advertising Council and add music to it that didn't take it quite so seriously what are the results dating from Willmar this June of 69 was a spot and anti-drug spot if there were a lot in those days as there are now I guess was Rod Serling Jason of marijuana in the United States has a felony don't treat them bad lately with marijuana some things that may be important to you in the Future Weapons smoke depreciating was brought to you by the National Institute of Mental Health at the end of every year traditionally WABC broadcast exclusively the top 100 songs of the Year between Christmas Day and New Year's Day through the the promos that I have done for this promotion in the years that I was there and by far the most expressive one is the one for 1969 the music that year was just marvelous 1969 on WABC Radio Christmas on New Year's Day is the power play of the year the top to the top music charts Christmas afternoon 7 radio as you know that discovered listen to are checks a lot of thought and effort went into the staging of and we developed a bunch of different kinds of production AIDS and drops and that kind of thing one of which were called slogan Jingles these were usually under 10 seconds slogans whatever that we wanted to get across the listeners these were used occasionally going spots to music instead of a Jungle Sometimes between a records in those rare occasions when to record play back-to-back this didn't happen all that often in the late sixties in 1970 and occasionally out of Records here's the series 3 slogan Jingles that I did and these were done and went on the air in January 1970 of Music theater theater theater music radio 77 WABC Dynamite on your dial how was your ABC radio station most music open Gmail using comes out to play please come faster most music music radio 77 WABC music radio 77 WABC music most music music radio 77 WABC radio Carlos music radios I think you can hear in the in that series of slogan Jingles the the overlap contrapuntal multi-layered kind of sound and we're trying for in the in the production of that. And a little later I'll tell you where the first of the movie called The lapper promos which spawned a whole production style ultimately it was said that I would make it jingle out of anything and turn it into a PSA and that was true Gemini gas while you still can that was a real 60s Relic Earth Day I think it was one of the things I really tried to do was when it was fun. It was incredibly simple this next thing is that that heavily layered contrapuntal engrams voice against itself technique this is the very first week in May of 1972 to with the names of the artists that were in the top 10 sometimes 10 top sometimes 9 or 8 depending on how it work when this worked well English voice and those of the artist tended to 20 I think we got better at it after this first one at least that's my recollection of it but this however is the pioneering effort but guess who found a brief moment by the Beatles in June 1970 the station introduced a talk show on Sunday night not particular because you wanted to do it because it was better than the religious stuff in network stuff that have been running there and Rick hired a guy by the name of Larry Baer assistant mayor or had some post in the city government the objective that we had early on with Larry there was to try to make him into a personality talk show personality on a music station that was on there only 2 hours a week at 10 p.m. on Sunday night this is a tall order anyway after thinking about it some and talking with the guy I came to the conclusion that the best way to do that would be by interviewing him and then cutting interviews up using them in 32nd promos where you said interesting things 30-second spot I still think after all these years of their kind about the best things that I did a w a b c and the notion is that they say a lot without saying much directly and most of it is in Bears voice listen if the war doesn't end very soon you let me not be anything left for any but I think sure they'll be more money for the city's I think of you more money for the states and I think more than the money you know they'll be a better feeling people will be able to feel the sense of commitment you know I think much more romantic 11 p.m. thank you very much for calling me and I appreciate your coffee the kids take drugs because that's what we taught him to do is it at all generation and the most extraordinary behind his whole medicine chip behind his whole advertising scheme says I can understand why kids can get anxious and 11 p.m. Sunday night on WABC radio 77 play some itching how do you wear it because it turns your wife on that I think that's great crazy or do you because you're hoping when you walk down the street the kids will look and say well he's probably hit you know it depends it's alright their conference call at 11 p.m. Sunday night on WABC radio 77 about what goes on in this city is it to people who are in it expect the government to do it all. It's very important that people get their you know get their taxes worth do I believe in that is a form of government is there 11 p.m. Sunday night on WABC radio 77 did a piece of production for the television side and this is I think one of the best examples of the of the overlap technique that had developed which was done as a promo for a channel 7 in New York Rodger Greenfield you talento de television to leave WABC 1971 new techniques in that slogan jingle series that I was telling you about earlier the difference in technique was to repeat certain words that we thought were the more important words to get across to the audience is kind of Shakespearean if you will here's what they sounded like March 1971 your kind of music music music you want your kind of music music music partly as a as a public service kind of undertaking in partly as a promotional device we put on a year in May of 71 a series of short programs that are usually under a minute called people power and the notion was to let people get on the air and say what they liked and honestly quick fit in with them libel anybody or slander anybody here use bad words or stuff like that here is the one of the promos and then I'll play you one of the actual programs that were doing that. It is important what do you think a boyfriend should be legal or illegal the problems in your community to +653-625-265-3625 people Fowler witb sees public platform for people to speak out about issues affecting them in the tri-state area called you battle cannot be won unless we stop population growth throughout the world immediately if we don't they totally just made with famine and disease possibly mean the end of man it ended about countries where Millie is already installed the population doubles every generation has been consumed directly or indirectly and 50 tonnes of food waste like people power WABC New York 10098 or call this number 265-3625 area code 212-265-3625 pretty deadly stuff most of the more of that ilk about 17 weeks.
