Johnny cry was the winner and he's a lot on the subject one of our local announcers in Michigan came out with a good line recently told me he just finished playing thought you'd enjoy that he said that the song went back so many years that he was still dipping girl ponytails and well when it was popular all right I'm from Chuck Manning Pennsylvania who says he thinks our mystery guest was Damita Jo know if I'm sorry I will do that was by Johnny Cash and the course our winter was Rodney height in the bombings in Heights Illinois he is an artist that we get a lot of requests to play every time we play one of his oldest people start to get excited about it cuz he was such a tremendous the way you got to just recently and had some big big hits or just a short time on the capitol label back in the 50s of this was released in the late nineteen fifty-six Sarah and it was a flip side of a thing called Crazy Legs it's from a mild Ballad by Gene Vincent and his blue caps it's called important words mystery sections I want you to be listening to something a little more but I think you're going to we did it once before in this morning going to have some fun with that we think will get you this week because we have something special planned from Paul chernak chermak of Seward Pennsylvania law say the Belmonts or Dion and the Belmonts theme sorry for all your rock that the information about Richard Berry being on riot in cellblock Number 9 was very interesting however the record was recorded in early 1954 by The Robin's not The Coasters it was a Libra and stole a production on the spark label Atlantic Records probably bought the master and called it a Costa records and two members of the robins and two others did become the coasters at the Smokey Joe's Cafe I don't know why I'm even mentioning this until probably got about 50 out the letter stating the same thing you're the only letter that brought that up and we thank you very very much by the way he says whatever happened to the remainder of your 1959 interviews with the various recording artist you know that I still have those my keep forgetting to bring them I'm at Funicello was on that as you remember and we had Pat Boone and Bill Haley & the Comets and I'll try to remember to bring it in I don't I don't know if we use the Annette Funicello one or not the police and I don't think so but that was very interesting her mother was even in on the interview she was chaperoning it what for seven albums he's worth I guess yeah I've heard of Mac Vickery I thought for sure it was very darvelle I do remember the song evidently someone else did it yes it was Johnny Carl and also thanks for being my little dear hope you can come up with some of the songs I ask for it while we certainly we've got yours listed Mary E Baker and thank you very much in Phillipsburg New Jersey new songs by the same artist I think we played one of these a long long time ago but the reason we're playing is not so much for the artist which very few people probably remember but because of what happened to her her name is Jean Chao Hew recorded for RCA Victor and some of you may remember that way back in the early 50s 5455 RCA Victor started saving the space on record by putting two songs on one side and 2 on the other and they would put one big hit artists on one side and then somebody else in the other and unfortunately Jean Chapel got put on the flip side of Love Me Tender and anyway you want me what you got a lot of money because of the records that were sold it if they sold any like that but this was on the flip side of the records that was sent to all the radio stations in which Elvis did Love Me Tender in any way you want me and we hope you enjoy hearing Gene Chapel first a real short one called welcome to the club and your boys that's Jean Chapel way back when Elvis was doing you want me heartbreak and Don't Be Cruel welcome to the club, no thanks to Sheldon poster engineer this morning who is filling in for Dave Schuster was on vacation and Sheldon was the one that said that sounds a lot like anybody's game o l o s y at North Tonawanda New York just remembers us from working Buffalo and thinks the mystery singer Junior for writing all so well from Mike Baker Ave Altoona Pennsylvania Virginia thanks Jerry Meyers them I'm sorry that several people said Gerry Marsden for that Johnny Carl restaurant in Niles Michigan miles from Perry says your mystery singer Sal Mineo I'm not too sure what it is but anyway we want to say hi and thanks for the program Terry and Eleanor Covington of Niles Michigan thank you very much.

Seem to be one of the problems that people put the songs they send us some for track and we have to go through all kinds of things to get at the re-recorded and so it's available for airplay I would love to have it I'm sure everybody would like to hear the one by Elvis the truth about me William Bell said. PS I was wondering if you could play Bim Bom Bay by Jimmie Rodgers Sammy can you make a note that I'm sure we have it back there we'll get it on next week also a good friend mr. It maybe Dickey Lee singing how will it and I'm sorry Bob Lally but that is not true and we're waiting for the tape you going to send us Bob thank you up there in Brockton Massachusetts toys are good buddy I want to congratulate him he was the one that sent in Johnny Carl record of how will it end you very much Charles appreciate hearing from you and thanks for stopping everybody for so long and want to say thank you also to mr. Gary Thomas of Gary Indiana who thinks the mystery singer was Dionne which is not right he said the first time I've listened to your program because I have a lot of old records some of them go back to 1944 flat remember a lot of the records that you play said I'm sorry to hear about the Marvelettes retirement and I wish you were on all night thank you very very much. It was recorded in New Orleans Louisiana at the JMM Studios on May 12th of 1953 and it was written by Lou Willie Turner and of course it's a recorded by the great Joe Turner hope you enjoy hearing this one from 1953 it's called crawdad hole I know where I can go all right that's crawdad hole recorded May 12th 1953 in New Orleans Louisiana by Joe Turner wow goes back a long time happy to have you with us got a nice letter from Danny Bosque in for your show and see if some of your listeners can tell me who recorded it while I hope you'll send it in to me. Because I'd like to play it I'm not going to tell him who it is because maybe was a stump up again with it I want to thank you very very much. He also said you probably already know so see if any of the listeners know that the El Rey's who are now the Dells first record was dialing I know it should be easy because they are all from Harvey Illinois unless I think somebody else brought that up to us recently but we're waiting for that other mystery so I'm going to have Danny we'd enjoy letting people tear that one the two mystery singers this week they're not that difficult so I hope that everybody will get in in the try to listen to it because I don't mean right in and guess because they are not that hard we played a long long time ago we had a request for it by the young man what a big medium seller in the 50s with a rose and a Baby Ruth George Hamilton the fourth and the rose and a Baby Ruth to become a hit he wanted this song to become a hit because he figured if he had a hit with his record he would get then offer to go on the Grand Ole Opry which he has finally done so listen to George Hamilton the fourth and one of his favorite all-time song is the one that he had on the flip side of a rose and a Baby Ruth if you don't know George Hamilton the fourth of you don't know a great guy but one of the few guys that still remember he's not with the Grand Ole Opry and I didn't mention the fact that George at one time suffered I don't know what happened but both his lungs collapsed and in the operation to save them they still Bears the scars on his chest and the funny thing is his whole life changed after that I'm pretty good clean living kid but there was something else that happened to him and he's became very very fervent in his work and then his attitude towards people and not doing very very well down in Nashville Tennessee with the Grand Ole Opry in a great great guy I think you're going to enjoy its on the flip side of a record that many of us remember because of the grammatical error Travis & Bob they did a song called tell him no and during the song they said something about much more better if you remember that line which for everybody up this is the flip side and if I'm not mistaken his call we're too young can help you with your trying to organize a student registration at your college campus or high school they Supply the advice publicity and 70 be her to 10 37 the Big Ten, as long as they have the day off 55 degrees sunny and warm temperatures Tuesday and again Wednesday High near 90 Windsor Northeast at 3 temperatures Northwest 58th Southwest 60 downtown Amrita Singh 58 welcome back to in the beginning this is the rock and roll song in so long I almost forgot about it it's by the great Leroy Van Dyke at how many of you remember that and what are they going to get it for him to get $30 there to make it there to get it and I'll have another folded on the 40 45 another picture.
