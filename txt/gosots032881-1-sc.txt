the shows at much the same format As You Wish in comedy is a situation comedy no matter if its 61 or 81 for TV has changed and the next gas thanks for the worse he's well qualified to comment too he was TV guide's put it from 1962 to 1974 and was famous for his no-holds-barred reviews of the best and worst shows the Man For Whom the word curmudgeon was invented Cleveland Amory I first began reviewing television in 1860 and most advanced age and I've been to Switzerland in handy operation and also in my second hundred years but looking back on the whole 15 15 years that I have new television show the most discouraging thing to me was that they kept replacing shows not only with shows it went better but we're definitely worse and what was it that made 60s TV better Cleveland thinks it was the devotion of his body in the book down the list of shows in the 60s and yeah there was Turkey is in the are there were idiots shows and there always is on that box but the amazing thing is sore then was a tremendous a riveting of the audience to the individual hours that the show is wrong for example he started a on this Sunday and you have Ed Sullivan Show GE theater Jack Benny show Candid Camera what's my lie then you had day you know Walt Disney even then Bonanza those shows there's no shows anywhere near like them today they're also shows that he just said my favorite was Queen for a Day you know because Queen for a Day was really a wonderful program it what it did was you you have the person that I had a most miserable time in life possible and then what tell is terrible hard luck story in it you know her husband would be burned to death in the three children would have been hit by a truck and mortgage people are coming to take the house away and she was just paralyzed him in bed you knowing what she was meant to keep it light as she was talkin UCI me and they didn't want any stuff too heavy and I honestly Wonder Woman got up and told something similar to that and she did it just beautifully kept it like you know I should tell Ruben that was your member of price you got six classes 6 wine glasses for a grandma shows of J's but what about the situation comedies I think that you have to say to yourself that it was fun pretentious we kind of outgrew those shows for what they were they weren't bad shows they always had some laughs in them
