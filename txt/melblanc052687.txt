half a century of what's up doc Nvidia But That's all folks half a century of Mel Blanc making us laugh with cartoon characters made real I don't Chuck secrets and talked recently with Mel Blanc and it's on Nolan California Mel Blanc sure loves to talk other times he's not feeling quite a bit more I can try to outsmart Wile E coyote come on get up on the wrong side of the bed please talk about himself it hasn't been about himself I knew I was different from the other kid instantly pink to me I would get a rabbit and a human Wild Mel Blanc even though you're known by the character voices you create when people hear your voice today ever recognize you until actually I did a commercial for American Express they took a picture of me and saying that you know I used American Express and so on right after that way every time I walked on the American Express commercial I have to say yeah let's do it the first time anybody could really recognize me the cartoon voices of the fears of the Warner Brothers in 1937 and if you created the voices of Bugs Bunny and how many and what are the characters there's Bugs Bunny Porky Pig Daffy Duck Tweety Sylvester Foghorn Leghorn Yosemite Sam Pepe Le Pew Speedy Gonzales and let's see 8 or 10:00 so they had to put it in the various little spots and they asked me if I could do it though so I did it how did you get that job well I tried for a year and a half do I went to the man who is in charge of hiring voices and for a year-and-a-half I went to this guy and he's always give me the same story I'm sorry we have all the voices we need and then every couple of weeks okay I laughed to Brown and I told him I've been trying for a year-and-a-half to give an audition so I did it for them they got a kick out of it one of the directors I think was ranked Ashland later became a big motion picture director he said I'm going to try to in coming up with a drunken Bowl you think you can do the voice of a drunken ball I thought for a moment could you my first assignment so you drunk they said yeah I think I can get what what do you sound like what are you doing next Tuesday I think I can make it well I used to watch the cartoons all the time and I see these various voices and I know that's one of the reasons I went to them I thought that I had so many different voices that they might be able to use me because I have almost every dialect and that's what I started with I finally finally did the studio at the time and he said I have a pig here do you think you can do the voice of this Porky Pig voice of Porky Pig fine thing to hand the nice clean Jewish boy you for a pig so I said that I told him I wanted to be authentic about it and I went out to do a pig for him and all the pigs for a couple of weeks and then I can come back to the studio and they kick me out to go home and take a bath which I did when I come back I said that that that that that that played at Michigan were you ever kicked out of school I almost got kicked out once for you in these types of things I want around in class with his voice is actually I did the Woody Woodpecker laugh which I did for Creative Kids later on in years and night early 1937 but the Woody Woodpecker laugh I did this thing in an auditorium in the high school one of the guys said you did that laugh I wouldn't I wouldn't say a word about that I think I did resent it to a Wonderland I wanted to do a Mexican dialect nice that they're building a home for a skill and I in Playa del Rey which is right on the ocean and I saw a little Mexican fellow there was shoveling the same and you know and preparation was rolling off of them I went up to him and I said boy you're doing doing an awful lot of work what are you doing this for anyways and I got a shovel with no blank what was it like growing up with a man who is really hard bugs Daffy Duck Porky and Tweety and it was terrific but I made him do even more this is really funny because when I was a kid I love the comic strip it wasn't a lot of Television around and every Sunday morning the big Sunday supplement Comics refused to come out so I used to sit on his knee for hours and say okay now do Prince Valiant do the katzenjammer kids do Dick Tracy and so he was not only too happy to his own cartoon characters but he had to come up with voices for maybe two hundred others for me you know and that he would do it he would sit there and go through all the characters in all the time except and then I had him do comic books of course so I had my own person of my own father was all these characters coming alive which incidentally he does if you watch them did you notice how many does Bugs Bunny or Porky Pig he actually acts becomes the character recently we took pictures of him doing maybe 15 or 20 of the characters and I can lay out the steel pictures in front of you and you can pinpoint them and you can think he must be doing bugs there are you send me the Sam there or Porky here cuz he actually I guess it would be transmogrified into the character and becomes the character and that's why bugs can be other characters you can say Okay Mel do bugs as an Italian chef and it's not mail doing an Italian chef is actually Bugs Bunny doing Italian chef in it sounds real Bugs Bunny girl bunny that's not Mel doing and he actually becomes a character in does it's like method acting these characters in a lot of characters and although Yosemite Sam kind of Tears my throat apart that's the most of May anything for me I was I was just into Hanna-Barbera to watch him do spacely on The Jetsons and he can actually shut out in space Lee's voice for an hour or two hours and I can't believe he's going to turn out now line 179 Airline 284 and he just keeps going and it's voice is resilient I have the loudest voice in the world everybody said so Daffy Duck movie over at Warner Brothers it's going to be out pretty soon but I guess Daffy Duck's third movie write a sequel to Ghostbusters only it's done with Daffy and all the characters called quackbusters and he didn't shout outs on there on the soundstages The Sound Stage 14 which is an enormous studio and they had him doing the same thing you did for two years ago and he was just as loud and even better than he was forty years ago trying to match screams with Daffy and it was incredible pictures of male doing all the character voices and then he's going to be assemblies and they love that but you know for Easter or Christmas or any of the holidays he's coming entertained the kids at all the schools I went to the weather in Benton grammar school or high school he was always there doing in fact I think you were you and Frank Sinatra didn't because Nancy Sinatra Liz was in my class and we did that and you did an assembly at University High School here in town picture of you I was kind of fun all the kids are always wait for him to come over and do the assembly tell me about this legendary car accident he just been up to San Francisco that day and he would do it like a hundred little 10-second commercials if they're literally a 100 for an agency called capella pair and read and he flew back down got in about 4 and he had another call in town at 8:30 in Hollywood and I was at a friend's house and my mom was at home and she got a call and he never got to the studio we found out immediately my mom called all around finally called the police and says with an Aston Martin involved in a traffic accident because he wouldn't give any names out in the police said he has an Aston Martin was involved in a traffic accident on Sunset Boulevard at 8:20 and that's why I never made it to the studio at 8:30 they were still cutting him out of the car evidently a kids car on Dead Man's Curve where there had been 23 Jacks before I went out of control he was driving too fast and it's huge big 98 Oldsmobile weighing about six thousand pounds at that time and building pretty big American cars and crashing has whittled Aston Martin that you only way to maybe twenty-seven hundred times was all just folded right up the fire department today took about 45 minutes to cut him out and they brought him over to UCLA in virtually every bone in his body was broken except his left arm which was sticking out of the window get a trip. Fracture was unconscious they gave him nine pints of blood the doctor came to me and said there is no chance maybe a chance in a thousand that he's going to live but we don't think it's going to survive the LA paper is the next morning either had obituaries or picture of the car crash in him on the headlines and I think the Honolulu people already had you did cuz it paper comes out a little earlier there so he was dead in a lot of papers and on a broadcast but he was unconscious for about 20 days and we try to bring him out of a Jack Benny would come over we all would come over and try to bring them out of the unconscious kind of an r that he was in was a very strange kind of a thing he was only semi-conscious he didn't know anyting and finally decided to have the doctor say to him in Bugs Bunny or talk to them as Bugs Bunny and he can take you to tell you the rest of the story now cuz the doctor would come in and see mail wake up you wouldn't respond but finally take it mail this doctor who is a brain specialist wanted to try something different to see if I was ever going to come out of it M8 always come in and say hey mail how are you and I wouldn't answer him so one day he came in and he said hey Bugs Bunny how are you and I answered you and he looked over at Noland and my wife was there still and said he's going to be all right he's functioning as the characters that he does and he will eventually come out of it and talk naturally so after 21 days I finally came out of it and this doctor was amazed to see he asked me to do different voices and I could do with that at the time that he asked me if I thought that I was dead and then my cartridges are still alive and I was still unconscious but I had to retain my voice and I've used it when he asked what's up what's up dog and hear his voice was even though he was in a body cast up to his neck in his legs were straight out in in a crossbar between them he had to be hoisted actually to do anything for 9 months they did then they started in the in the hospital to record a lot of The Bugs Bunny make and then The Flintstones were just starting and we built a studio at the house and pipes all the cables underneath the house to it bed and actually the first two years The Flintstones was recorded in his bedroom he was flat on his back with a cast around the bed and a microphone dangling over him and all the cast would sit around the bed and you can still hear the original Flintstones episodes does he still play them the first maybe hundred shows recorded at his house of him flat on his back what are you involved with right now all right now I am doing for a park that this featuring The Bugs Bunny Bugs Bunny characters Six Flags acid and Magic Mountain also the film adapted new Daffy Duck's quackbusters in the end you got two films for The Jetsons Meet The Flintstones and a Jetsons full length are thanks to Mel Blanc an old blanket in Los Angeles
