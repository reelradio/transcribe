flowers like a Diaries and I work 12 peach trees that it was Springtime broke into delicate blossoms of Team conferral headed in for Rich fruit the birds out of the trees and sang so sweetly that the children used to stop their games in order to listen to them happy we are here they cried through each other one day the giant came back Japan to visit his friend the Cornish ogre and it stayed with

a very Gruff voice and the children ran away my own garden is my own Gardens at the giant anyone can understand that and I will allow nobody to blame but myself so he built a high wall around it and put up a notice board trust pastors will be prosecuted is a very selfish giant the poor children had no nowhere to play they tried to plan the road but the road is very dusty and full of Hard Stone's and they did not like it things to wander around the high wall and invite her over and talk about the beautiful garden inside how happy we were there they said to each other when spring came and all over the country they were little blossoms in Little Birds only in the garden of The Selfish giant it was still winter the birds and the trees forgot the blossom what's a beautiful flower footage from the grass but it was so sorry for the children that it slipped back into the ground again and went off to sleep the only people that were pleased with it snow in the frost spring has forgotten this

to him to be the most beautiful music in the world he'll stop dancing over his head has a Northwinds East roaring and a Delicious Perfume came to in through the open casement I believe spring is coming at the Giant and he jumped out of bed and look out what did he say he saw a most wonderful sight through a little hole in the wall and every tree that he could see you there was a little child and the trees were so glad with the children back again that they had covered themselves with blossoms and were waving their arms gently about the children's heads the birds were flying about in the ring with the light and the flowers were looking up through the green grass in the Laughing it was a lovely scene only in 1/4 equals still winter it was the farthest corner of the garden a little boy he was so small that he could not reach out and cut the branches of the tree and he was growing all around it crying bitterly free was still quite covered with frost and snow in the north wind was blowing in Roaring above it melted to see Lookout I was selfish and I am very excited now I know why the spring would not come here I will put that poor little boy on top of the tree and then I will

into the garden but when the children saw him they were so frightened that they all ran away in the garden became winter again only the little boy did not run for his eyes were so full of tears that he did not see the giant coming a giant store that I never took his hand and put him up into the tree and the tree broken Once In The Blossom of the birds running around the Giants neck and kissed him
