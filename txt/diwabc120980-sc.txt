Street Bridge is having the 130s down through the 70s I remember it like it was yesterday and I remember Sid Bernstein that we were talking to before on the phone overnight here at WABC set up an interview with the smile and the Beatles and Scott Community and they were in the Warwick Hotel and they said they reminisced about it just a little while ago I remember when the Beatles were at the Warwick getting ready to do Shea Stadium 65 and Bruce Morrow asking me to arrange an interview with exclusive interview for your radio network which I did because Rick's flooring tomorrow and then very very friendly and helpful to me and my early career and arranging defended him in there in there wilmoth AMS suite at the at the Warwick but memory is exciting Mormon women you know I forgot for a moment that you just reminded me about maybe seeing that exclusive radio in a few seconds well we do remember that particularly well because well Bruce and Rick were in the studio I were in the hotel I was back in the studio and we had a three-way conversation and during the course of that time I thought it might be interesting to hang a microphone out the window and get some crowd reaction over 10,000 people young people out in the street and I remember that the thing that was most disturbing and most interesting was the fact that the police couldn't understand what I would have said the kids were singing along with a Jingles police didn't have transistor radios if they're like the kids did and this is the way it sounded on the air and why you're in such a great mood is in such a great mood everybody stand by do you think they could do it a little louder this time we play a different jingle firm yeah they'll try it again in their great we love them that's almost ready one more time deserves the Bills record right let's go I know whether you were there or listening on the radio but I was and it was absolutely incredible is one of those things you remember all your life we have more Beatles music coming up on the station with the jingles your morning is going with a great taste of Maxwell House Coffee yeah we we had a wonderful time that day and the Beatles text many topics even tangentially or not so tangentially depending on whether or not you really listened to the lyrics touchdown this topic was about a time when Julian Lennon John son came home he had drawn a picture of his girlfriend Lucy is it a schoolmate Lucy and said this is Lucy in the Sky with Diamonds and that's where it came from and was not about what you thought it was about John also would have wrote it to him which eventually became a tune about my daughter and this is we just got word from Joe Nolan that's there is quite a crowd at 71st and Central Park West in the police are now asking people to please stay away from the John Lennon's home because it's causing a traffic problem and so it goes on this day we have more team coverage this morning with John Maher what's the latest development of John Lennon was often been described as the most controversial the most outspoken and most politically aware of the Beatles in front of a twenty-five-year-old David could do little more than 1,000 people gathered outside the Dakota this morning the crowd has dwindled a little more than a hundred mourners WABC John Lennon was dead we left around midnight hey man I just thought we were

the gym turn on the radio being louder I figured starting to really get the better of me if I'm making calls and I got a real I just couldn't have completed David many people couldn't understand why John Lennon wanted to live in New York City certainly there are safer places well Lennon always did what he wanted to do for whatever reason I didn't always make sense to us or even to those close to him take for example John's decision to remain in the u.s. to live in Rome officials to stay here in 1972 while government began proceedings to deport him and Yoko because of drug charges against them in Britain but the Lennon's one and here's how I happy John reacted when I get dropped off over I can get on a plane 40 John W ABC School Board in Monday Night Football Miami down to England in

But we knew before the night was very much underway who had its little girl in the engine McGowan another word said the cat out of the bag we had hard right capture I think she stayed with us at the hotel and we made it broadcast in the morning and do we still went on all day long as I recall saying we're looking for John Lennon's metal in his I remember we had a press conference for 5:00 that afternoon and it was attended by I think everybody but the New York Times for some reason I guess they are trying to come around a trick it's been emotional COO of the age of holding out of that metal and keeping on the air with pleas for people who may have had it had it how do you feel in retrospect are you happy about that you think maybe it wasn't quite kosher or was it just the way the game was played in those days the show business just as this taken another's days we call the W a beetle say 10000 singing at 1 about a half hour ago and Noble Park Avenue that must have been quite a lot of people out there and credible crowds at this particular time and so prematurely John Lennon his methods to untimely end only been up most of the night haven't been feeling that well and John knows the most most creative of the The Beatles and and of composers and composers material it is backed up for family of The Human Experience and John was was very philosophical Yoko is pregnant with cheese play some music on what life is all about and wondering what he he was saying in a wife why are we here am I am I one of my really doing with my simply doing what I'm supposed to do or try to explain the inexplicable I never believed in waiting till death door before facing the Eternal Mysteries and so we all eventually come to that moment Rick thank you I'm sorry to intrude on you or this morning but appreciate your comments good talk to you I'll talk to you later and here I W A B C
