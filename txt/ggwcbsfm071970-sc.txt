in the next couple records I want to do a kind of a parlay things for you like remember when the Beatles did back in the USA I'm in the back in the Back in the USSR right off the White Album Back in the USSR of that record came from an old Chuck Berry 1958 called back in the USA that's what Chuck Berry did in 1958 and then this is what the Beatles did on their double White Album so you see the Beatles more less covered that Chuck Berry to and from 1958 and one of the latest hits the Beatles had which I would bet my bottom dollar that nobody knows that it wasn't really written by The Beatles the words are different on the tune but this tune you'll recognize and then we'll go into something else but I want to play this for a fact so they tunde s alright so we get through with what I'm doing now we all know that that was the Beatles write with Paul McCartney singing lead don't want you to hear something everybody thinks that was the Beatles original to in right will back in 1948 a record was done by the original Roberta Martin singers and was recorded by Apollo that listen to this okay what do you think about that how can there be any doubt that all the McCartney of The Beatles got that from this recording was made in 1948 on Apollo by the original Roberta Martin singers and it was coming out in which was just called that Delores Barrett is that during the high for soprano and to think they will delete this far out so we covered of course Back in the USSR by The Beatles which they obviously cop from Chuck Berry and length of the biggest man stays within the last several months, which everyone gave the Beatles credit for again when they didn't really write it themselves now if only the words were changed the music the Styles remain to protect the innocent at all so far out hang out.
