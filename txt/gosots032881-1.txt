and most advanced age and I've been to Switzerland and have the operation and also and 92nd hundred years but looking back on the whole 15 15 years that I love you television the most discouraging thing to me was that they kept replacing shows not only with shows that weren't better but we're definitely worth and what was it that made 60s TV better Cleveland thinks it was the devotion of each audience look down their shows in the 60s and yeah they were turkeys then yeah they were idiot shows as it always is on that box but the amazing thing you saw them was a tremendous a riveting of the audience to the individual hours that the shows were on for example he started it on this Sunday and you have Ed Sullivan Show gec Jack Benny show Candid Camera what's my lie then you had day you know Walt Disney even then Bonanza do shows there's no shows anywhere near like them today they're also shows that he just Queen for a Day I guess I said my favorite was Queen for a Day you know because
