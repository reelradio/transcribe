we'll go back to the very beginning with Michael of grown up together we understand each other and we'll get a perspective on their role in the history of popular music from Carl Wilson it was a real sacred thing for us to make records in to try to do the very best we could and we'll get a look at the Beach Boys darker sides from Al Jardine was really uptight about it Josh and responsibilities and we'll chat with a man who's got the beat drummer Dennis Wilson some of our biggest fan Bruce Johnston I'm kind of the cheerleader I like to tell everyone how great they are a bit of spice to the proceedings of the Beach Boys he likes them and I'm sure when I get to meet him also I like him you were on another planet the first week in April of this year you recognize the somewhat humbled voice of Secretary of theinterior James Watt found out sort of the hard way just how much of an American institution The Beach Boys are and will tell you more about that later on on the show all that and much much more with the fabulous Beach Boys without hanging out that's an ancient custom that hasn't changed much over the years and today I guess most young people like to hang out at video game arcades but if you were a California teenager back in the sixties you hung out at Carl Wilson remembers very well well the first I remember the group really is Denison Michael coming home from the beach one Saturday and the buzz around the house was well we're going to start a group and make records about going to the beachand that was the first recall I have of the groupcall HoneyRyan and Michael had been together for years singing at high schools and churches and stuff and then I saying with Brian at a high school assembly one time cuz one of his friends got cold feet and I had to fill in for him to pull up apparently the Beach Boys feet never warmed up in Carl's been with him ever since way back before then to those early Surf and days before the Beach Boys Safari began Brian Wilson one thing of course was my brother Dennis who was a surfer at that time then because they're also affecting you know if you know anything about servicetonight was cut my head cut off do me a favor not just your bad cuz it's been going on so long so take a lesson. Beach Boys and cashew a nut a minute and think about the irony of that then the music business in general imagine that we had Brian Wilson here a man totally unlucky it's surfing writing surf music like that now we touched on that subject than other conversations enough I asked Brian to tell me about the people who influenced his kind of music I think cuz I recall it was it that you listen to as a kid and he said I think The Four Freshmen actually were the biggest influence in my life they influence my harmonies and of course they're Harmonix were advanced in comparison to whatever what's going on at that time and here's what happens when those Four Freshmen Harmony's meet the sound of the surf then one of the two or three most influential recording acts and all the Rock and Roll History ranking up there with a Beatles and super producer Phil Spector the matter fact a lot of new wave music for some of the old waves at the Beach Boys and the funny thing is music what is sounded a lot different if Brian Wilson's folks hadn't gone on a vacation back in 1961 my folks went to Mexico one one day and they left car on Dennis and I some money to buy food on get food and any other to hang out you know and and stuff and what was the result of that came out of that Cervantes they only like the only way from me now surf surf Amarillo hours search Diplo call Pop only way for me now surf surf Cervantes they only like the only way for me now, pretty baby answered with me at 4 o clock to do to Bahama pop is a real rock and roll for you the very first Beach Boys record surfing from 1961 and to show you how times have changed just listen to Carl Wilson description of that ancient recording session let see Brian play drums at the pencil and I remember to take your shirt off and put it on the drum to get the balance right now and plate stand up bass and I play guitar and we staying alive going to take it was like one track record it was needed stereo it wasn't even by The Beach Boys As a matter of fact that you'd think that a group who hung out of the beach would naturally coat would have come up with the name the Beach Boys Mike love tells the tale the idea never occurred to actually a record producer named rust Reagan named The Beach Boys is now head of some record company the spring of 1961 I got a phone call from a friend of mine from Candice records Joe saraceno he played something for me on the phone and it sounded like she was called surfing buy a new group he said call the surface all my God you're right I forgot about that what the heck are we going to call him so I'm going well it's surfing maybe we call him the Woody's or the lifeguards what are they kind of thing I want to send I said Hey Joe what about the Beach Boys he said that's it we're going to call in the Beach Boys go surfing now everybody's learning how to fart go surfing now everybody's learning how come on earlier and told us about the influence of The Four Freshmen I like to think of the Beach Boys sounded more like The Four Freshmen meet Chuck Berry surprised Listen to I was really under the influence of Chuck Berry and just very in love with the stuff and a I want a tip to make music but I just you know something that I just played guitar and so the group coming up with a dream come true all the music of Chuck Berry also figures very prominently in The Beach Boys first big concert Jabba Ritchie Valens Memorial concert a vague memory of it was the first time we ever performed and were billed as the Beach Boys on a big show that was a rich even more valence Memorial dancing show is on New Year's Eve in 1961 at Long Beach Municipal Auditorium and they have like the ikettes and the rivingtons and I hope she knows that's all of her she's friends will be there they said they know the first song you played on the remember which was written by who and it's a song that's very very close to my heart for obvious reasons because text David Lee little sexy. about a half a million I come so quick it's all right with you all the cats three little Gracie 5 years later in 1963 here's how the Beach Boys paid tribute to the legendary Chuck Berry what California I'm down. Surfin USA we can't wait for June a lion Surfin USA I asked Brian Will Smith beat ever written the song that was very special to him but maybe the public it overlooked the little girl I once knew I thought I was done beautifully and it had a introduction that is in the introduction I'm just saying that for all the listeners this is so they give them a lot better I leave the introduction and I thought that was beautiful look at Griezmann choice of words out on eugenius Prodigy see trends that are some of the nature of a man a man they Brian Wilson now if you had a brother with those qualities we might be a little jealous but not so Carl Wilson I think it Brian just I mean you know he's obviously a real big influence on music great teacher to say the least I work very closely with Brian I was kind of an underling person with him you know a lot of Beach Boys in the Go-Go's and a lot of stuff is coming for the last couple years I was made to love her that would Brian Wilson possessing all of that talent that his brother Carl was describing earlier he was sort of Destin to take over the production chores in the studio and sadly is Brian admits that would lead to conflict in 1964 right around just a bad maybe June maybe May June of 1964 I took over I thought was my father in the recording studio I shoved him and told him to leave I was very upset with him he would heat I've been arguing and he never came back did you ever resolve that their relationship absolutely we had that all resolved one day I die started crying and I said I'm so sorry for shoving you and I didn't mean to it and I told him I said I want I want this record to be right the way I feel is right it was I get around was the record that we were equivalent over up and down the street maybe you're getting the middle name cuz it's never been Mountain the success of that tomb would weaken the control of the gentleman who managed the group Brian's dad Marie Wilson and would also put their producer Nick vinay out of a job although it really didn't seem to mind first off every one of the company's growth including myself every Man 3 the brine without a doubt was a bright talent to adjust scratch the surface of making records and the father I thought he was boxing Brian in and then the man would come up with his own Melodies he was competing with Brian also he would write songs on the piano and they were really kind of the cerebral pop songs type things and I think that this was beginning split their I think that Brian started to realize what it was conscious or subconscious that the father was in a sense of competitor title of Steve Brian and then if you will give me any thought that pops into your month fun fun fun we were in Australia and we were listening to dubs which they called dubs demos dubs of fun fun fun and we were trying to decide if that was the single and we everybody said hey what's that Alice got a great d how do you start off with a man named Chuck britz doors have water called the closed recording sessions meaning of course no Outsiders are allowed entry but not the Beach Boys we were doing a party of them back in studio two and I'm just all sitting around just playing guitars and goofing around and we had a lot of friends coming from outside Jan and Dean all those guys are one of those guys is truck mentioned was Dean Torrence of Jan and Dean now the two stars were in the studio just up the hall from The Beach Boys and the why they were on a break Dean Torrence decided to Mosey on down the hall and see what the Beach Boys were up to I walk down the hall versus party going on in studio be a lot of beer a lot of my friends spell bologna sandwiches if I remember that was when Mike was in the hot dogs and I think I walked in with in 3 minutes we are doing Bob ran for what reason I don't know I think they say it was my idea but I don't even know how it came up with the idea I think I kind of asked him what year of songs for doing it for them at this very moment they said they name some tunes I said our brand has welcomed parts has the bombs and had in it and it's a Happy tune okay started out okay pick out of keys so we picked out a key actually think it starts about 3 or 4 times while we're finding key take a shower. baba baba baba baba baba baba baba baba baba interesting you'd figure that with the Beach Boys Jan and Dean competing for the top spot on the charts week after week after week they might have been sort of protective of each other's material sort of like about Xerox and IBM zealously guarding each other's Trade Secrets but we were locked in a listen to our tune shrug the shoulders and we went nuts I mean what's up Brian that's really really great so don't try to talk Brian into giving us Surfin USA Car Sales up but I do have another surfing to net that is similar I don't have time to finish it right now it's kind of lost interest in it but the basics are there and he sits out the piano any place to girls for every boy I was the opening we said we'll take it. Remember I doubled with it but he was louder than I was there's always something they got it covid-19 Brian Wilson Solway would become a number one record for Jan and Dean in the summer of 1963 Surf City collaboration and yet Brian roll Tunes with a vast cross-section Apartments including a man who not only made the association radio show at about 12 at night and as soon as Rodger in the parking lot in Hollywood and Brian would come to the station of it and I will go down to a place called Aldo's restaurant and have hot fudge sundaes and write songs together was a song called shut down which is a story of a drag race Duluth matter fact it was Rodger who would provide Brian with the link between the 60s surfing sensation and California's classic car 32 Ford and it was the first car I ever owned and you probably remember the very first guy you've ever had in your life as you have a soft spot in your heart for that car will you know that I was just saying what it was me I had to do and even though it gave me a lot of trouble at one time or another still as you know he'll find memories enough to spawn a song what you did what is the weather icon by the way those cartoons weren't their way of cashing in on a crazed on the contrary you could say that cars of the very reason Brian Wilson made records you say why but because I I want to I want to sit in my car the front seat of my car and just listen to our records say a w sounds good on the radio that amazes me I mean you think that would keep going on till Lake hard you away you'll always be seeking me some people seek the perfect wave you take the hit record I also would lead to his leaving the Beach Boys into some rather dangerous experiments will have that story coming up next is our salute to The Beach Boys continuing to Brian Wilson and yet the pressure of writing the songs making them come alive in the recording studio and then performing them all over the world was beginning to take its toll on Brian and that's why in the mid-60s rather than quit the Beach Boys as El Jardin reminds us. He was dodging responsibilities and they were pretty rough time so I think that affected the group because we fell through because I'm usually the Beach Boys are a family and they stood by Brian this is his brother Dennis Prager Brian's person I want to hear the bean what's going to happen healthy Andrew Davila so we'll hear more from that album in just a little bit but in the meantime The Beach Boys had to answer a very pressing question who to get to replace Brian on the road on the man they found was a Hollywood session guitarist who went on to record such hits as Rhinestone Cowboy in Southern Nights Glen Campbell I was at that was a lot of fun how could you not have fun touring the world and singing songs even a ride about home Glen Campbell music of the Beach Boys one was a man named Terry Melcher in the other was this man Bruce Johnston a few moments ago about how Glen Campbell filled in for Brian Wilson on the road but it was inevitable for Glenn to pursue his own solo career and obviously the Beach Boys needed to replace him in the candidate Bruce Johnston coach Bruce came highly recommended by himself I was sitting in an office in Los Angeles and I got a call from Michael love and this was April of 1965 and he needed someone to replace Glen Campbell who is replacing Brian and I couldn't find anyone I said how about me said okay and my first Beach Boy concert was April 9th 1965 what were some of the songs that you played at night Texas good me and say just can't be beat. what is technology you don't want Bruce Johnston join the group is the more or less permanent six-member rumors started circulating once more about Brian Wilson he had become sort of the Howard Hughes rock and roll a virtual recluse in the Hollywood Hills and for another thing is living room was supposedly filled with sand I stumbled across the idea about environmental that word environment around you know about about a foot music if you were with us from the outset of our show you remember we briefly heard from Secretary of the Interior James Watt build the Washington Monument that's a concert by the way that's been headlined by The Beach Boys two of the last three years well it seems the secretary to side of the Beach Boys were not quite the image he was looking for well it didn't take long for the backlash to hit it seems the secretary had no idea just how many friends to Beach Boys had including some friends in very high places like the president and mrs. Reagan it was a very humble secretary W who appeared before reporters quoting the First Lady boys were fans of hers and her children growing up with him and they are fine outstanding people and that there should be no intention to indicates they cause problems which I would agree with this is unit secretary wise decision The Beach Boys 1969 the kind of music Bryan Wilson was hearing in his head far surpassed normal pop Fair some people say that he felt he was in a creative race against John Lennon and Paul McCartney other people claim that Brian just couldn't help being ahead of his time but whatever the case The Beach Boys set the world on its ear a 1966 with an album called Pet Sounds it wasn't exactly Surfin Safari as a matter of fact it wasn't like any pop album ever made before I asked Mike Lovett Pet Sounds was difficult to record difficult in the extreme I can remember doing 20 or more 25-30 vocal overdubs of the same part and when I say part I mean same section of a record maybe no more into 3 S 4 seconds 5 Seconds long passage of when it be nice we did it over and over and over and Not only was it because to get the note we wanted to know that's right but the Timber and quality of each knows and how they all the four-part should resonate together and then Brian would be here and something to nobody could hear including a dog and it was exhausting but it came out pretty good that's a little bit of an understatement from Mike love here is an example do that please the record producer in this case like we did last summer but they got Pet Sounds and I didn't know what to think of it because it was a complete departure but it became a unbelievable of milestone in terms of record production and a monument to the Art and Science of recording that stands to this very day Brian Wilson will be with us to tell us about his favorite songwriting partner of all time when our holiday salute to The Beach Boys continuous
