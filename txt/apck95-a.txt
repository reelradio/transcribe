hi this is Arlene Tech I am here today to welcome you to my show Watch Out World Here Comes Arlene and I've got Amanda de Casey cases we've all heard a musical countdown to the top 40 he is the youngest man I believe who was inducted into the the radio hall of fame he's got his own star on the Hollywood Walk he's he's we do this is Casey Cason where do we start the job for myself because I was in the radio club and here we have a large radio clubLebanese Revolution was so what happened was when my father came over and Tena when he was 14 or they went to Mexico and he came to the United States and when he did the last name first name is our last name simply because they was born here and then went back over and then my father came here and there which is fine because I was I was a reporter did 1982 I was in Beirut for 5 weeks and in June of 82 and I've been there bad back there since then.what country was going to go over from an organization called the American task force for Lebanon so I went over to Canada and I got as far as England and they asked me for my passport my passport I forgot it may just come on now you lost that you didn't forget it nobody asked me I went back over the Atlantic so that we can put it on a plane if they could take it down there and they wouldn't do thatthat was awful country to Justin B nothing is worse than releasing Fantasy Island and then I did a lot of shows can't can't they go all of me at all that I can the late 60s and we did it on the network for about 22 years the longest running network television show of its kind on Saturday morning and I played the character who is a sidekick to Scooby-Dooand his name is Shaggy and show us that was on radio and then then on television called our Miss Brooks & Light plays Richard Richard Crenna play Garth Brooks the night I sort of borrowed that character and that became the character of a little bit of Dave holtrop are you told at one point that they had to stop doing the crazy outrageous is lucky enough to be at the headquarters company of the crew radio network in Korea Armed Forces Radio and they put me on as a disc jockey in the morning had to get up at 6 but what happened wasgetting up that early meant that I'd probably have to go to the studio pick out some records and take him to the booth and I didn't always get up early enough to do that to one more career you were doing this in the morning and I called myself crazy Casey well the officers met signed a petition to get that Maniac off of you I really was crazy because was Armed Forces Radio they have taken the melody of the music andyou and music and there's no more music anymore. Island and we know who sell illegally the songwriters of the past do you think has been any any hope for the future and what you feel never been identified with anyone kind of music but I also have never closed off my ear and giving myself a van Gogh here otherwise I eliminate one errand and prejudge the music because I preachGalvez and everybody learn to love Elvis I preached unto the Beatles people and I think most people are like that and it's unfortunate because it is I say you develop a van Gogh ear and all of a sudden you're not listening carefully like young people do young people listened to both ears and if they like something they gravitate toward it and embrace it and a lot of young people are doing that was rapping of course I agree with you certain certain way right now so I made it with Nat King Cole and Natalie you know now because of his races and the two of us I would hear this this music Italian singing and I would have Casey with but butthis wonderful music and song by some sexy Italian they've been hearing that for years and years and years over there but he brought it over here 30 became popular and he was actually in Spain soccer player and a very good person. Did he start pass the time play the guitar and sing and The Weeknd interview and here was this huge room you know that holds 5000 people in there but just the way you're sitting out in the back up and there was Hooter her face to see any of all the girls in thereoh my gosh missing you today in the closest I ever got to Elvis was when a date and I a girl I was dating went to to Vegas we weren't in in Las Vegas and we were passing opened up maybe a couple of weeks before we were passing by and saw the room was packed up to see if I can focus and we have the worst seats in the place right down dead center stage right in the middle and when it happened was that I can't just the right time because they haven't filled up thesethose with high rollers got down on his knees leaned over the stage and kissed her about ten feet away turned around and came back and kissed her again while she was she was in another world but an exciting thing to happen to a woman and a week later we were at the Greek Theater and then go to the same thing but that's the closest I ever got there I was fittingand it was a big party and I didn't know I had I had been to a show he had to let that afternoon long or that night and they had a private somehow I ended up going to have my mother and dad and it was the same thing you know where where Elvis Presley came over and gave me a great big kiss before you went on the stage I'm staying because I didn't think he was that you know when I look back in retrospect speaking speaking of dehydration also in diet things like that we've had discussions with that the things that you're most proud of you try to encourage others to be vegetarian oldest children are and my daughter isand I know that hamburgers and I really don't do that anymore I don't even have anymore I got rid of them I don't feel right just doesn't in the old days you know have a nice pretty for total yeah but now it just makes more sense any good that's that's that's Linda and they sell vegetarian dinner ready dinner is good oh yeah oh yeah if if slaughter houses were made of glass and people could look into them half the world to become vegetarian overnightand I agree with that that's why I took the pictures and she said I'm grossing out you were standing on a goat hoof they don't listen. It is but after that she never touched yeah we're both very proud of that I haven't smoked in guys 10 years I quit the day after the another day with two weeks after the announcement came out back in 64 or 17 years and I was a 4-day of the four for four pack a day guy and I would stay up late at night till 2 in the morning just so I can smokeafter the announcement and it was a gray hair doctor from down in Florida and had the white Smock on and everything and said if you don't have lung cancer now consider yourself in good shape and she stopped smoking today you won't get it I can wipe the Slate clean stopped right then and there never had another cigarette except when I did a couple of movies where I pretend to smoke but then I must stand as smoking I'm just because I had a friend recently to have a smoke doing okay it's been at least 7 or 15 years and Iit was an accident almost who all God has wanted it had to be right then so so it was still with Dad about a half is if is one a week or once a day so I was writing for a house spa for my newspaper town and I was invited up to some house but I do like a fasting spot and I went up there and he said he can't have any sides that made City nicotine any caffeine in this cigarette that I saw my arm was like yeah I do you know where whereI still have the rash in my skin looking young and I'm thinking I don't wanna do this anymore and it really once I stood for the four days it was and I never want to smoke most people can't smoke can't stop I'm not stopping thank God but Gandhi once said the only way you can break a bad habit is if the bad habit is standing in the way of something you want more now I quit in the way of something you want more than you wanted more to be healthy than to smoke obviously when I saw that the Hollywood and once I got here I figured I am I going to kill myself commits suicide after working so hard to get where I really wanted to be so I stopped because I want to be alive to enjoy any success that I might have and so that was youwe obviously had to be successful somewhere to get up there I heard it's beautiful and I started out as an actor on The Lone Ranger show on the radio show in Sergeant Preston of the characters from 12 years old people to take people out here that really have no idea what radio are acting was and you did radioactive do you want any of the toy that was within two or three other shows as well as the Green Hornet Bob Barclay American historyradio radio is is the best medium for using your imagination and which radio you can create million-dollar set billion dollars find finger Martin and that's why radio so wonderful because I probably picked up from being on on radio is an actor picked up the idea that you can tell a great story on radio & Paint any picture you want to paint and so that's what I do on my radio show with doing human interest stories and so on and of course I also read the request and dedication so often called the long-distance dedication and that too is it something that each person can imagine in his or her mind and if you could you would you would say that I feel the same way with with what I write because I thought it was something I say that's like painting a picture with words so it's the same that you was going to say the words and you try to make a picture in them you have a conversation when I write something the same thing as like drawing a picture you want and you can create anything you want to create doing something Noble about to do another one in person there's only one Jerry Lewis I need my medicine at the 2:38 on the other one but and 12 of those nationally with Jerry the last couple of years old nationally and locally hosting it with my wife and karoly KTLA anchor people and their wonderful to work with a J and Carl they said that they wanted me to put Casey's credits as and they said Put it is jeans husband's you know so if I can get your own identity I guess eventually but but you got a little baby named Liberty birthday on May 31st and she was born on on July 4th they said 5 in the morning on July 4th July 4th or Justice if it's a boy Shoji degrees is at least we didn't know whether it's a boy or girl but she became Liberty image of the hospital he had a name that's in the Lana and I had three children under three I had newborn one and a half in Two and a Half I didn't want to go home so I can make it for you have you take her home is go baby tiger as they why not you either had a lot of other causes I can receive it quote is one thing about nuclear March 3rd in Soviet Union in 1987 are they were Soviet citizens that American citizens in from other countries as well and it was too March against an arms race nobody want and then before that I've participated with the folks who marched all the way across the United States from Los Angeles to Washington DC in about 9 months so I set up for different fundraisers on the radio along the way the children of Chernobyl right off of red square and the animals were one of the groups from from England that came over and I co-hosted it with the a newsman a Russian use man who'd grown up in the United States if you know this but I am I spent quite a bit of time in Israel and Israel they have a I believe it's like a bad group area there was a date Hasbro very many children from turnerville really bad case you are and how they taking them and they raise them and you know protect them and they're back and it's really scary like a pic of the KGB for smuggling a prayer books then is that a friend I really wish the second time I went we we could see the Americans can see that things were changing under Gorbachev they were really changing and when I tried to tell that to people back here or not it's nothing good things are really changing we all felt it because if we could talk to people about politics and nobody was going to put them in the bag 76 if you tried to talk like that you had to be worried if I could really yeah they were they were watching you everywhere and I would have sent a guy was there and they had the bugs in the synagogue and it is really very dangerous then so you were there to promote 10 years later you know what also different people and they admitted it they weren't afraid to say things politically that I thought would have got them thrown in jail changing LED how is right in your area every year you know we were both we both Believers in the end and World Peace guy knows we ever get it but it's it's it's within our reach anyhow you what it was that was starting to 70 series it was something that you were that you're famous quote was the hell else about Michael Jackson you were can I see Michael Jackson I have a nice to have the think the other two Michael Jackson the singer is no longer Michael Jackson he's really he's Diana Ross and drag now I met him and talk to him when we had lunch together with several other people that's what I think a couple of years ago very shy didn't have a lot to say talk about vegetarianism and he said he had to really get off of he was a vegan and that's what I am a vegan is someone who doesn't eat fish meat fish poultry or dairy product either a traitor to the vegan I had to go back to having cheese and eggs because of my weight loss was just enormous and when you become a vegetarian you it's very easy to maintain your your weight things that are rich in calories if it's all right if they go together I agree I think starting with him out with the nonviolent music to though yes we do this is actually this is my anniversary this year we've been 25 years so you and your body will respect you for your wisdom the animals will love you for your compassion and strokes you at their folks you keep coming back in to watch me because you made no because you made love is see me never hate us cuz you're terrific and you just keep coming in and watch out World here comes early
