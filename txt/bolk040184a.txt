The Greaseman and the discussion of the Greaseman of DC 101 in Washington Scott Shannon of Z100 in New York City and we want to thank God George activities for assisting Tammy had to have been putting that together that Volvo everything you heard was on the air use got have a cast of characters Friday I would like to say you always we've been approaching is like it's Greaseman and then Scott Shannon tonight I actually produced on Morning Show with a with a whole cast Ross Britain whose phone with Ross and Wilson on WABC and Jr Nelson production director and Claire Stevens we when we took the other and small jazz station in the mail about 5:10 is about 21 do you work alone at work alone but I can't help from some peoplePlayStation everybody to station is going to pictures in to make me look good if they encounter a sound effect of noise and I got a buzz that they think I could use to enhance a bit I'll give it to me so it's the news headlines come back we'll talk about taste how far they can go how far do they go lower know if popularity is it a fad is going to stay long time is it the return the personalities to radio I guess they're Scott Shannon and the Greaseman on Larry King in Washington and will pause for news headlines and come right back with more this is the mutual broadcasting system your network for news and sportsthis is mutual more than two feet of snow in 1 hour less sleep before going to bed 1 hourPresident Reagan was Dixie on Saturday Louisiana Walter Mondale continue to argue about delegate committee spending this is the mutual broadcasting system here's Larry the two of America's major of morning personalities Scott Shannon and the Greaseman and what you heard of course and you may wish to comment on when we go to the cause is certainly unusual is the disgusting in my life complete scope a delay so I have six seconds to dump somebody if they nail me too bad we work without a net danger special in New York Mets wee-wee pre-screen him in an occasion something gets through but you know you got to please happening grease on on FM is is a is a place for music just because of the Republic notion that FM's better Fidelity I guess it is a little bit so then what we would think they would be less talk on FM so why are the personalities occurring on FM or is this the personality fitting the music I just at the the major music stations on FM now and so they used to be a family has relegated to a classical music and Hip-Hop stations but nowadays everybody is on FM playing music and drinking so that's why it is degree lot of the problem comes with the fact that people buy FM facilities for instance in Fringe areas you know I've been from the outside and I was just more FM signals I know where a guy who owned the station and paid the $30,004 now worth two hundred thousand pay $200,000 it's worth the 5 million stations are going on the outskirts of Atlanta like five and a half million dollars and therefore people are putting more music and all the station sound alike how do you differentiate you get somebody that they can communicate entertain and it cost money is there a lot of talent around there's a lot of this year he's around as far as the back in the mark and you wanted to find somebody that wasn't already under contract for another major station to do your morning show you have to do your some looking it to be honest it's it's very common and program and also almost daily get calls from people all around the country where they always take the morning man is the key in it and it is however the problem comes or not enough people trained people to be morning men in the trade Publications such as billboard radio on ryker's I just looked through the radio and record yourself on the way over here and it had like five ads we want the nation's greatest morning man for our station and there's there's not that there's not that many great radio disc jockeys out there to do morning if they don't get into the basic things in life I just a few days ago Candice Oregon was here she was this microphone and there's a little suspecting of Candice Bergen saliva still on here and I tell you what it just drives me wild knowing full well that when I lick it tonight I'll be there close to Candice Bergen now and it it typical radio for that would be might think that and would be generally afraid to do that look good radio personalities and all of us who think we are good broke rules coming up right now. I think I think sometimes rules help you know you have problems with which to work and you're always kind of right on the edge of the end that gives you a little juice gone another thing there is a fact that so many people are afraid to be themselves on the radio and when we first moved our radio station know if I work for Cleveland they call me and said we're going to go into New York and I would have gone with one of the big networks because I'm a rather unorthodox radio station he like the Greaseman if that's that's kind of person I want to my radio station cuz you would like for dinner I'm a big fan of he was legendary in Jacksonville for years and when he was in Washington but the thing about it is when you go on the radio and you and you act normal friends insist it's Taboo in most markets in most radio organizations to mention other stations in the market other people we congratulate someone for doing a good job in New York is a fellow my name is Scott Muni he was a wonderful just dragging around for years he's in the hospital we wish him the best and if someone's copying us are doing something we did we talk about it talk about it you knock the other stations as well we've been known to do that on a case there are in the vein of your kind of ability and then try to change them and get everything set from there from the get-go when you're talking to them about the job you have to decide you know what you want to do what they want and I think everybody is clear but all you're ever needed the microphone you have a happy time there but it's when people and I was like a married woman's cuz you was getting the bikini then when she's yours no more bikinis one-pieces trench coats at the beach as the same thing that they put on your house with laughter and then you say why it's funny but I don't know if I could do it on my station will in your slit your own throat what are the parameters got what are the hours of this might be hard to discuss how far do you go one of the first you don't use the seven words you can't use right no we don't we use terminology that people use in everyday life to a certain extent will use a LOL damn we don't use it all the time we don't use it out of context to shopping if it's a natural word that comes out of your mouth and I believe you've been known to utter one of those two words and this is been charged to make fun of ethnic groups and homosexuals well the general pattern of this scholarship through we'd all just a lie so we don't do it and it weighs we don't do it on a consistent basis on Archer we might have something like Frontier decorator you know Frontier from Boston to redecorate the west and it's it's it's not that's not where we call ourselves the Z morning Zoo an equal-opportunity offender nothing serious and that you that it's been said that my should I don't really put down anybody yeah I went through a lot man you said you never get in trouble if you hate everybody equally and then after we don't hate everybody but I think if you're if you're doing it just didn't like fun and I I don't really mean to say the set aside ethnic groups but if if if you have this a whole world of people out there and people are funny and if you do it in the spirit that is amusing then I don't get complaints from any ethnic groups recently at our station was about a month ago I had given my weed wheat we stay away from specific and I we don't do like we don't do the Polish jokes for safe and because of the nature of the show something somebody that represent these guys are fine they make I mean this horrible hate letter in the mail from my local police later he says I will find a way to stop you and it was so strange I read it on the air and all the sudden all these calls came in all my long listen I apologize I'm polish and I love you show me the guy was just he's one of those guys that needed some publicity and wanted us to read the letter your shows are a reference all right I mean you don't have not that's not the right word we don't go by the old guy lines that's true but we have respect ya after these messages from the nation's capital this is the Larry King show this is Rich Little is Johnny Carson inviting you to join me for a marikkas favorite program as a matter of fact Larry talks more than all three of my wife put together Larry with Scott Shannon in the Greaseman where Coast-to-Coast on Mutual is it and this would be the greatest fear of all a fad well I made some good money on the way to the bathroom in the radios on I think we went through this all right then. Maybe I'm still thinking that that's still occurs a format radio in that format when Rock started it was time temperature and play the record a Larry down a hold of you at DJs came along who couldn't do anything beyond tell you what time temperature in play the record but throughout those. There was always a Wily Phillips if you're from Chicago if you're from New York there was a bobbinray in there was a dinner with Arthur Godfrey on the networks and 5th Miami there was Lee Sherwood you always had presented within the management and in Los Angeles lomaland Berkeley why did they why they succeed over all the different they were funny yeah but they were always just use the one in the town right now that's changing do you have somebody that's doing a stick and he's doing well with it, do you free plan your morning I don't I don't do my I just walk in there I read the paper and then I walk in there at 6 and five things some of those some of those two as production pieces yours are magnificent. I think about us than the previous record is playing my son will call up and say hey here's an idea and I'll think about it that's pretty funny though it doesn't believe you I don't believe you but nobody's at intelligent. Specially you how much I want them to see me over the years and do it and testify to this way how much of the zoo is pre pre plant we're very pretty and we have written my partner runs and IBM computer and we we we do about 3 to 4 hours a day on the next day show me and in the afternoon you sit down we do it between 10 and then we would you want protection pieces with JR my production director if we're going to write a song a parody you know we're going out to Yankeetown and you can't compare what Griezmann does what we do it's two different types of shows when you say we're both different but our shows are quite a bit different unique for the morning I want to know that this flamboyant Behavior I think we're both unique and what we do for the morning but nowadays flamboyant behavior is coming the by wait for morning success what about midday back to the easy listening you change midday most stations do 5 because people basically want to hear the music the rest of the day you're amazing I see they don't want to laugh at 2 in the afternoon. They don't want to laugh another one of the things that is very expensive to get into a budget what do you want you know you do you want three highly paid entertainers on a radio station I mean only afford one so the morning man is the guy that gets the most right and then the rest do you think this kind of thing if budgeted that way I could work say 24 hours 5 Zane he's on a station I give it to go if I had the money what the hell let me see it you know if you can get the Five Guys I just over the most hilarious in the world and put them on I give it a shot and see what have nobody's done it let's see nobody's done it we keep sending guys there any women doing what you do Russian women personalities I think that the market is right for the lady boss Jackson listening tonight I think that if there could be a lady that was on there just flamboyant devil-may-care get get people on the phone damn up and down that there a man you know that woman is looking at a hundred G's tomorrow he's right there's been to this day there's been no morning personality female discharge is going to call and say when someone someone Peoria but I don't think in the business has ever been a woman that management except maybe in all new stations put on in the morning weather lady comedians they can be funny like a business to trust a morning to a woman's voice so hungry for morning radio personalities if a certain radio station manager was presented with a great tape what we call Meir checks in our business which is a demonstration of your work as a resume on tape of what you do I think you'd hire and I be I don't give a damn about whether it was a female or male it's too big and too much more competitive business if she's good she'll get judged as being a disc jockey and female do both of your kid politics and politicians what happens to be hot that morning but yes I have done some of it and we're very very much into that we have at on Jesse Jackson singing a song about hymietown right that was real popular in New York that was a short a short hair shortly but we did another when we have we have a school as supervisor the head of the New York school system Anthony Alvarado you may have read interested he's under suspicion off of that way and for money some money that he borrowed from his employees and people so we took an old Supreme song called where the love go and Tony Tony where did you would rewrite the lyrics and it's a very popular song on a station of satire I guess so the Greaseman and Scott Shannon and will be back right after this message Malaysian Capital you're listening to the best of game highlights of previously recorded Larry King shows when you hear phone numbers please do not call Mouseketeers Larry with Scott Shannon of Z100 the zoo station in the Washington do you do a lot of remotes to is it still on after you go out and meet the teams from a bar having of April 26th people can come by I have Bloody Marys at 0 600 and we do parents as you know the weekends I'll be at 2 and record store is you do the do a lot of that number to call for a Greaseman appearance is wait we don't like to do the show out of the studio that much because it's so hard we use the phone so much and a lot of people recorded things how about personal princess record hops is the old man of the old terminology record opening of the new Shopping Center how about to support group isn't any business of queens and country music and hockey players have their groupies and baseball players do you guys get offered when you get very popular television I done some TV I just happened to the Godfrey's in the Bob & Ray is right we seen for a while I've done we're flirting with a couple of offers now in New York but it's you know it's such a difficult job to do a truly wonderful morning shows recent tell you 5 days till we go to 10 hours a day 5 days a week that takes a hell lot of sex Larry right now it's the impression the business that the closest New York it's tougher the competition stuffer and the talent is better is that true well save in Tampa certainly certainly did have a lot of people sending I was concerned when when I moved from Tampa Bay or I had a zoo there and has had to start over again I work sweetheart years and had wonderful people at the radio station overtake Q105 in and the partner that I work with there remained in Tampa and I'm going to New York and it's a brand new station I was a little bit apprehensive but when that kind of thing happens to me probably just like you have been in the past when I do is I just close my eyes all the outside influences and I work but his New York better is the town of better in this competition Suffern New York I got to be honest with you not a put-down to the talent but there's just about the same level of talent for the size of the city in New York is in Chicago and Los Angeles is a wonderful just one of the greatest morning in the country and to take Washington several other fairly good talents I think it's getting to the point where the the revenue is so important that there's always at least two good competitors sometimes up to 4 but the New York the closest New York is necessarily better is not true there's no doubt that Don Imus when you agreed it was considered the number one morning man in America for some of the years but quite frankly in this is only my opinion. I just got tired of doing it and it's just not the old spark from Washington much better in Jacksonville it seems like in the business that people always asking do you want they want to get to New York or La I don't really think that's important I think you got to do your best and then and be as creative as you can be in the relief to me the, the bottom line is you know how much you getting paid I've had guys going to say yeah that's a big time to me I would go there I go to Paducah Kentucky for $400 a year I think he done to me I would have made the big time give me a big old house big ol Southern house is there you know I don't have to go to work in New York in the radio business want New York I was very very happy and and planned on the long long time and Tampa Bay for I'd really love that that area I work for a wonderful organization but the individual that call me mr. Milton Mall some more broadcasting presented in Greece made a very good point a lot of young people in any job is this is Chicago or Milwaukee but the most important thing to me is because of the style that I use in the in the differences in my management style I like to know who I'm working for that's real important to me and it's just nothing and I think it's important to make enough money to support yourself but it's more important to be happy with the people that you work for you would not been of Love Jacksonville to come to Washington if it wasn't more money just to jump markets right I would never go anywhere just to jump Mark if he hadn't provided I was happy where I am where I was and then doing my job is that the general among your peers as well because I'm not really cuz when I was younger that wasn't the real bad if you could jump in Market you jumped you could tell you can tell how long has been in business by the size of his U-Haul for a while there I think it's so stupid to take yourself sell your home if you have a family take your family move into another city when you don't even know the kids are going to work for you there in about 2-3 months do you know what has all my god what have I done I don't want to be you anymore as long as you really get a kick out of doing it to get off the end sometimes your stomach hurts when you walk out of them cuz you've been laughing so hard after the morning and I don't think you ever have to stop for you that you wouldn't be ashamed if you were a 65 year old now that was going to legend that I am station at a gallon and a 60 amp was Father's Day forever wonderful wonderful announcer I mean do you feel I get that question what what's next you come to New York and I haven't conquered New York I had 28 great months and I develop I love being I love entertaining on the radio that's my relaxation relaxation to me that's why I have my fun and you'll do it no matter what age you are news on the IR a word from you say that to me a word from your local stations and will be back with your phone calls for Scott Shannon and the Greaseman two of the four 10 this morning disc jockeys in this country they do what they do when they march to their own drummers this is mutual your network for news and sports satellite find a Chester closed because of a brush fire with by high winds were Smith Air Force Base or B-52 bombers and cruise missiles are station according to Mike. Now I'll be on call all through the night to keep watch then I'll probably whatever Oscoda Michigan this is Bob Ross senior attorney with the transportation department of Washington which oversees all of this baby too much electricity for Moore air conditioning if they kept their clocks an hour later diplomatic immunity Euro and investigate inside like in London operators at the Diablo Canyon Nuclear Power Plant in California hope to find barn metal protest listening to the best highlights of previously recorded Larry King shows when you hear phone numbers please do not call now here's Larry thank you and we're back with more of the Larry King show our special guest tonight or Scott Shannon of Z100 in New York and the Greaseman of DC101 in Washington and the Greaseman Austin Texas hello question for you canoodling with the Yankees and what do you look like I'm sixty-one 90 volt Brad bulky angry definitely a weightlifter nose runs but thank you very much keep the level of Maryland hello what do you think about the syndication of popular DJs throughout the United States I've heard some talk and read and don't worry about the possibility of going to get some guys that are popular like you and spreading around the rest of the night to 711 markets okay how about that how about doing this kind of show in the morning would it work nationally it was funny funny but there's an emphasis on being local you're always going to be behind you a local Affairs and therefore someone is equally as funny as you are on locally they're going to have the advantage by being woken up but wouldn't it work with Stacy to the other lot of stations in the market to be just one station it's been tried several times have a b c d a b c never tried it was Super 8 on an even got on the air lost millions of dollars so you don't think a National Music Show with a host like one of you is a countdown show which is you know some has some humor in it but basically it's very difficult to be topical and and be recorded Grace Auto V live satellite every morning I thought about that I thought it'd be as a washington-based that it would be lying I take local phone calls I think that the sitcom shows on TV are fun Archie Bunker was based in the yard somebody's base AKA papa is out in La funny is funny and as long as you can be a part of it I'd like to be local take calls and yet still be able to you know broadcast thank you it was Scott Shannon of the Greaseman Jacksonville Beach Florida hello hey buddy I'm sorry how you been how you spell police hey buddy I'm a long way baby yeah how come you didn't call me back when I called you about 2 weeks ago New York again and soon the Tampa don't get embarrassed but the rumors flying around town that you're coming back not true okay but you did down here with Robbie Rose and Paul Dempsey and that but I'm doing it on my own in the Washington 8:37 and the countries on the mountain. Sure but he had such a following and send it to your friends all over the country Greece man was like an American Legion in Tampa I'm not with these a logical what guys think of New York and then you left and I don't know why he's retired right now and as matter fact there was a recent incident where another station was negotiating with him and they couldn't come to a settlement so he's he's he's is ready to probably get back in the radio just his partner died he was telling a guy Charlottesville Virginia hello I was going to come to his music. They were betraying the public trust and all that but I thought it was that was a very who ever did that was very sick he responsible individual that is not good radio you thought it was ivy league types I didn't want to say the name of the town I'm there thank you to Virginia hello sound for the good tip grease by they got your braces Maya 57c to sleep fiberglass and I keep burst in the Potomac and his twin diesel sucking gas making the sound that makes a whole person go stand up and cheer and it sounded just started up just to hear the noise will be back after I'm going to cry these messages to the best highlights of previously recorded Larry King shows when you hear phone numbers please do not call here's Larry our special guest tonight or Scott Shannon of Z100 in New York and the Greaseman of DC 101 in Washington Raleigh North Carolina hello I left the Cracker Barrel in Georgia off of years very good condition and are Jeff Davis in Chicago's North Carolina to run down in this area I never really worked I worked in the area but I wasn't really in my Curry I started my friend mobile wabb while I was in the service so I kind of fibbed about my experience and work part-time and in the Fayetteville wfld into w f p s was in the service and then I moved into Columbus Georgia and I got out of the service and started my real radiokorea Maryland hello I got it from New York to agree on that tape that he can make up tomorrow doing good getting up a second or two separate occasions I called him know when you could have done anything like that in and 30/42 he just did it in the mess I never wanted to thank you thank you West Hartford Connecticut hello what's the number one on there was a guy here in the Hartford area in Washington still not for the foreseeable future is always the same one we always call The Greaseman we go to the Pittsburgh hello do that type of people around town that I think you could do personality radio up until around Beyond around somewhere nobody was ever so I don't think any more outrageous that Daddy and nobody I don't think I was ever more than a ride riding stand run family for all his talent I think the last time I went somewhere with your reward any kind of Bud in and one for the Greeks logical enough management that worried you know yourself there were times in your past and just be honest you are extremely talented individual but there were times in your past when you did things wrong and you didn't and you challenged management are you always right same with me when I was a baby DJ I think Grace is always kind of nice to people but there were times when you had some problems too I'm sure you just can't crack it so you have did that just that in a sense of where you are I wasn't inferring it all of the names mentioned by that gentleman but there have been many many different times there comes a time when you start to believe everything right about you and you are God and you're going to tell the general manager what to do if he's still your boss the station will still be on the air when you're gone the one thing true of every one of the business we are all subject to the likes of management if they don't like it they don't like it on the hot line Mobile Alabama I worked wideboy live there if you and Cleveland while you were there I hear I was too distracted wsf for a while and I've got a couple questions for you in New York now I've also used to live in New York and the same way that you did in Tampa and and if so let's say I'm trying to raise myself your house and you format was developed while in Tampa and 54 was still in Tampa doing a very very fine job on that radio station shifted it to took it to New York we altered it to a different Grease Grease Grease when he's in Washington but I would be more than positive that there were some changes and some alterations you made in some of the things you do great radio people don't go from Station to Station and do the same darn thing they did their you have to alter you custom build your program your radio station to fit the community simple as that when I was in Mobile I was a nice Chucky Arizona super sham 7 Belfast John Jack and it was loud and I really wasn't communicating on the level that I communicate now I feel that's where the music is part of your your rap I don't actually talk on the phone or with the music but I do like it's nice you know when you're sitting there thinking what to say if you can come along and not be hating it is it wasn't the doctor on WKRP in Cincinnati pretty much saluting what you guys do wasn't he our image of what you are I hope not you not you don't think it's funny and good and yourself just Jackie's are all arrowheads and Float around and I have personal interest I have personal Hobbies I am more than just a crazy man on the radio and just like my friend but your image perfect the crazy man on the radio are you like every other talk host of course not check to that image on a very well written sitcom how did you regard him sleeping all the time I'm always tired and that's one thing in the morning man you're always just unusual thing about that in and he was kind of close to the person that writes that then put it together who held it was was an admin in Atlanta when I was running a radio station and the actual general manager is a facsimile of a fella by the name of Jerry and all the other characters of blonde Lonnie Anderson secretary was like ours was designed after the station wqxr in Atlanta I was like that show we go to the Charleston South Carolina hello Charleston South Carolina and Jacksonville a 10-9 on a wine whatever he didn't want to take a nap in the Washington Post in Washington to swap tapes you do you know take me and watch it and you have maybe have old tapes from Jacksonville you can swap and people are really Fanatics and you can probably do that that's what I do I can I don't I don't have any tapes for sale in Jacksonville and I don't know if you ever coming back but I want to wish you the best of whatever you might be wanting to do your very kind but I loved you there how many happy hours as I can remember half of it when you do the other guests about the Gringo in Mexico you know a man and I don't know if I can get you didn't Larry Joe and I know if you worry don't worry about that the breaching of wind and washing and then he didn't actually do things are different washing New York hello friend of mine move to Washington Gaithersburg asked about a year ago and everything that he's been telling me about you and every weekend thank you. Totally different than the conventional type of morning something I'm used to and even though have to do with aw and I have to wonder if you think go against the typical Loft no comments and trucks that are done by the DJ I'm going to Scott Chandler Z100 New York City and Greaseman of DC101 in the nation's capital this is the mutual broadcasting system through our Network for news and sports
