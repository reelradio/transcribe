I went to driving and I was with a girlfriend and we got in the back seat and we're watching a movie and they used to have these guys riding around in the drive and don't know if they still do my bicycles and this guy was cruising all around in the bike and we had sort of just roped to a good degree and all of a sudden I looked over and here's this guy knocking on the window of the car and I think oh my God it's a whole over my window and covered up as much as I could and he says your fog lights are on but that was all he said that kept me from doing anything in the driver for a while it was busy but nothing of Nancy who spent 13 years in Texas was getting ready for her favorite day of the annual Sadie Hawkins Day dance and the girls would ask the guys to go out those are the most fun you you got to pick for woman in the 60s that was a very fun thing because you weren't you usually just kind of playing Coy but that was your chance to place a call you got dance with me astromatic memory comes from who was already growing up in the sixties he was in his music that is until he met that younger girl I started dating a younger girl then who was into pop music and so it was like our second teenage phase for me getting into pot just for the Beatles broke here and so that was my introduction to you know what was the garbage music to my age.
