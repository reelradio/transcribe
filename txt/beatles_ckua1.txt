Tommy Steele Cliff Richard has that one of the big rock and roll artists just one of his big songs called Rockin the caveman a rock with a Chinese man caveman Style got my head all the people down the

This Big try to be a good boy Majestic Chris is going to die. who should I go Patricia Cliff Richard from 1958 of the first big hit one of the number one songs of State on the charge more than anybody else up to that point track a call to move it before that you heard of the early rockers he and his a theme song for most of his career before that and then rock with the caveman this was the biggest hits of rock and roll era and it was pretty sure it was homegrown Tommy Steele and the steelmen tummy still went on to Major stage Productions because as the Beatles hit after 1962 there was very little room for anybody that wasn't a big group another important note is that one of Elvis Presley did not feed did not tour Britain it was said that in 1958 and the now 71 year old Tommy Steele says that I almost called him up out of the blue one day said I really like your music came over and spent the day with Tommy Steele and not to her let's go to the very back yard of The Beatles now and set this up a little bit the cavern Club as you all know was very important to their career they'll each and everybody that was in the cavern Club had a standard set list and all the groups including the Beatles had to do those set list or else they wouldn't get hired bobbler the DJ ruled at that time if you had a single you'd make sure the Bob wheelerwood plants he would also be your computer or your MC at most performances here's a group recorded live at the cavern club actually in 1963 Bob war is the host the group is called the Big 3 on folkerts this morning Billiards bar hayama lights down low so here we go with the big 3 Jones the Mecca Cafe here in account existing that is the codependent with Billy Council on lead vocals the man who told me the beat the Beatles he wanted to sing like Paul and John and he indeed it achieve that one of the finest voices in rock and roll anywhere Billy Council that that is a Carole King song and done in of course the Beatles style you can hear Steve benio on the lead guitar they're just copying those lips that came out of George Harrison's hand before that a group could have been should have been as they were the group that the Beatles wanted to be they call themselves The big-3 that goes back to November of a 1963 a very very rare live recording at the cavern Club a little note of interest is that Brian Griffith the guitar player in that group is now a guitar teacher here in a Cavalry and has left that scene behind many many years ago has many great stories yet to share we are looking at the beetle Roots here on a full crew to the core song writers American songwriter has played a very valid part and let's hear something from his own words Arthur Alexander wrote a song called Anna that the Beatles took to the top of their charts in their early recordings is in his own words in the song writing session notes you know I went through a lot of misery and I also hate going to like up and I'll I got to hurting you know being in the business that I was in the right about now cuz I'm going to get some money you know you guys know this song Alright people who don't know this song. You'll see where the Beatles came from tribute to the girl I love the you know very first one so I can think about you baby you say dream dream dream do you have iHeartRadio John Paul certainly learned their vocal harmonies from the great Everly Brothers Dawn and filled with creating a very unique vocal quality you heard all I have to do is dream from of the Everly Brothers one of the big songs of that time and before that you heard from Arthur Alexander just a little bit before he passed away unfortunately 93 a live performance in the bottom line in New York City in their own words and are just alike mink Deville and the Rolling Stones also did version of his son as a did the Beatles let's go on to Ringo Starr focus a bit on him he came from a group called Rory storm to Hurricane as the Beatles were recording their debut album Ringo was imported into the group initially didn't play drums on their first single Love Me Do but actually the single that was released later on he did play drums on in the former drummer Pete best was ousted from the band in about that time so we'll start was quite new in the hurricane is very much in the spotlight in Rory storm even had a feature spot where he performed country songs one of the country songs that he performed came from the classic Buck Owens they're gonna make a big star very great James Burton guitar player who first worked with Ricky Nelson Dale Hawkins Elvis Presley Johnny Cash, Merle Haggard John Denver Gram Parsons Emmylou Harris and Roy Orbison to name a few he's still around today still creating great music and if you're watching the Elvis Costello show spectacle he does appear on there from time to time he was the Telecaster Master P was also one of the major influences on the guitar players people like Eric Clapton Jeff Beck Jimmy Page George Harrison certainly loved his Memphis guitar style course development through the stylings of Elvis Presley before that the great leader in a country and rock music he was one of the first guys to really create the Bakersfield sound that spawned artists like Gram Parsons and continues today to be one of the seminal influences on early country rock the roots on a focus this morning my name is Tom codsworth we've covered as much as we can in this our only scraping the very very surface of the some of the artists that influenced the Beatles hopefully you get a general idea for where they came from 1962 they released their first album and their last album was finished in 19 is 69 their influence still exists to this very day when we come back in the second hour we're going to be featuring the artists that were influenced by The Beatles it is our folk route back after this
