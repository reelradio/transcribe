talking about raising the oil prices and I don't know what would you do I shut them off for what they need deodorant you wouldn't know it'll be interesting to watch Jimmy Carter's personality and habits change now is he becomes president there was an article about what comes over a man when he's in that office in fact their articles written about just running for that office when you suddenly find yourself surrounded with Secret Service people other people making your Arrangements the adulation of the crowd during wherever you go wanting to touch and be touched that's all very cosmetic it's not really you know you're saying a lot of things you're speaking aloud you're making appearances you're having your picture taken with you I really do much work well you're you're working hard at that but not working to do anybody any good suddenly one day you walk in the office have been briefed by the president by the Secretary of the State you met with members of Congress you walk in the office and you say I had no idea was that bad that that's got to be said of a gruesome feeling good to realize it suddenly you have the responsibility you want to go any place you got a whole Air Force there to take you think I want a weekend in Coronado you say somebody takes care of it Jimmy Carter was seen carrying his own clothes allowed in a garment bag over his shoulder anymore he won't be able to do that that's right and eventually in the next year or two years he will become I suppose it's like they all do eventually and that is impressed with their own importance not necessarily Harry Truman at the end of his administration Renee was through I could been inaugurated Harry went down to the train depot guys went to Kansas now that's true with Harry Truman do the Air Force didn't fly and they just got on the train with a Kansas City he was unique in that way my excuse me of KFI not like we're holding up Bruce Springs you Bruce Dotson Southern California Datsun dealers
