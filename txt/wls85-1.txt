Trust me on the Airfield where I thought I always heard you up in the air used to being up in the air lot of times but you were never really up there a Chicago accent I think I have one of those days those and DMX in the sure why not but I can shift gears if I have to do you know that and I don't like another day is done on those guys yeah I don't know Gene Taylor so I never been up in the helicopter but you know they ask you why done with the helicopter local Home Depot clearance price that we had a bad thing of it is that they have them. By the way how are things going to do is shoot down to WGN traffic, yeah that was been two things right the worst day we were on Leary way around the area and that was the last time we crack that shows some kind of jokes about that. The reason we kicked off without you by the all the Hollywood argyles was because that was the first song when SS was the barn dance station actually I guess a w l a w s m in Nashville which is the Distance by answering the net Grand Ole Opry for thousands of years at least it when I was in Nashville about last summer I had a chance to see the original Grand Ole Opry and I want to tell you that was it was quite a sight WLS before that even was the original barndance station I come in I don't know how do you know a tree Andy Williams red Blanchard OK Google darling Scotty Carl Swanson with a big heroes back another 30 years world's largest door installers that would be nice and then it has the history portion. I got a beard it down call Yolanda house on the air and there is no parking lot to the history that you kicked off LS original and responsible and lock him up and Peoria wirl and the other day on the job he was about three sheets in the world after the first day that we were on the are no and then in 08 I can mention dick biondi without having you know he's going to be on there with me Sunday afternoon to go ahead where is he he said where did you get him I have never heard anything like this in my entire life and I don't sweat it was my fault the rest of us had and that we knew what was going to happen otherwise we would have been able to buy all of this stuff on credit why did Moore's case he came in from New York and I came down from Milwaukee and I can put them in to Pittsburgh Pennsylvania you started something up for me and one Sunday night we turned off the prairie farm station and here was this nice stayed radio station with the stock market Fortune of live from the stock markets in the south side of Chicago I only know the following Monday morning like a radio station in a call from Sam at home and he said why Bob why don't you and Dick come on down to the station at midnight Saturday night and practice and Frank engineer from New York was in a minute Matt Fred wanted to find out how good the signal was on WLS so Sam and Gene salmon and Dick and I came down to the station and I don't think we played any music we just started talking Angela phone calls and Afraid went out there and I guess the first half hour he couldn't find his Beyond Skokie and maybe Joliet if we were lucky he went back to the transmitter in tuned it and then the calls started coming in was okay we got it now we got a $50,000 radio station that went around the world but you were the only acting childish and as far as playing contemporary musicals and Halo I wasn't I wasn't wiser than the way we started personality and the other than that we're doing it in any kind of a format they were just playing it as each guy said well I'll try playing this I'll try playing the play one that's why I just need to make it three times an hour but when Sam came in and he came in with a successful format that was working elsewhere we'd all come out of a format radio station but you a cargo being a conservative allegedly conservative city was up it was about the last major city to go to a format rock and roll radio station with maybe the exception of LA and I'm not sure if they were into it at that time early afternoon because they were having do you guys remember what he what he's writing so that guy still around like this radio station as as running garbage an open sewer running into the homes of Chicago is that why are why what you talkin music or what is some kind of age of of pubescent on up and turn them into raging sexual Maniacs this is bad and it did happen after these cousins having a knockout of a sale today through Sunday and at all 20 Peppers locations as the truck been around here live with Sam Holden Taylor Bobby Elmore Crowley and officer British royalty you sound just like a radio announcer thank you I just wonder speaking of that I'll be watching over our shoulders that ever happened when we were here but one of us if everybody else want that one guy had to do this all by yourself we could signal cuz Eugene don't worry about a thing here on the big 89 I mean you know wow man look for the jingle down awful Pizza music again . I love these jungles in a long as I can Tunes talk singers ladies and gentlemen of the big 89 I got a couple of a kind of trashy music and I don't like you. In there people said he wouldn't like that junky play on the year you guys really like that crap and we say yeah there's nothing wrong with it because I was invited to the Lutheran High Schools and churches and youth group and that subject would always come up or you going to be corrupting the morals of our teenagers City Iowa I got a lecture on the church steps one day from the pastor because I was conducting record hop scene and he was one of the preachers back in the old school in believe in dance to get this is more valuable I thought I was supposed to take her story and Leah. I've already checked with hail and I checked with home and I haven't checked with you more. I ran into it was at a CYO hop some place on the south side no matter what to do the record hop and the music down because the nuns were going to sleep all through it and doing everything else and you do the dance contest giveaway a single and I throw it back at you out here tonight that was $300 right when I want Jeff that's right three hundred bucks would you like a check or would you like 200 cash my per second on that side in a record hop downtown here at the Chicago music on Randolph Street second floor and I struck a deal with this right now that my deal was worth about two hundred to 250 allegedly know that was he was going to write a schedule but that was a Sunday right and the business the first few weeks was a little slow like fact we have like 40 people and and so he don't go for a hundred today I'll make a deal with you where you get a percentage will give you a 10% yet on when it really starts coming in 110 black guy in about a year and a half because he made sure no matter how many thousand we're out there that money never showed up at the front door like no matter what okay. That was not that was Bobby Hill talking in the first argument about who is going to do what record yet because Bob Hill was cutting the undies rape she's right you are in the bar I refused to do those things that you did I hated those little bastards I love them as listeners but I hated to get out there in the Hops and have to stay there and watch those what he does a body as you just ride with Jean out there working out that way hours I love dance contest I just raced one handle it's great fun honey.

what you were doing at to KGO and you said the hell we didn't know nobody knew how to talk in those days it was just kind of winging it just felt I was just when I first came out here I had that kind of decided that I was not going to be any more are work I came out there and discovered that I discovered that I had to put myself in here cuz I couldn't afford to hire anybody else after we all lose ever do that the question is your function any better I'd like to find out what everybody is doing right now as far as career and stuff is concerned we got to take a break so we can pay some SS truck button honey Gene Taylor Bob Helm or trolley Jim Dunbar from San Francisco across how many years did you say you were from they 18 years and I moved over to another facility you doing now that's what it was possible and being paid accordingly and I'm going to be involved in America's second commercial what we call officially International high frequency radio station Opelika Alabama no matter what you are moving to Alabama I like Opelika Alabama I'll be backing up and heading down there in the course of the next month or two and it was a title that goes on from here until there and I need about two pages on the business card and I was one of those vice president and director of programs and services for MDX eglobal radio Opelika Alabama on my way down there going to be a number to commercial shortwave radio station first one is wrno out of New Orleans and they really don't merchandize themselves internationally they essentially from my understanding duplicate their FM signal on a station in New Orleans and once in a while still some program and we're going to go out and attack the multinational and international advertisers with a radio station that's going to be playing music and I was going to be competing with the BBC and a boiled and Radio Moscow in the voice of America and Radio Moscow I think I can beat radio picking I'm not really sure that's what I'm doing is this and why you how is it that you and Ella has came to part company that goes back to Hell Neil days now the trouble was I said anything about how well he was still with us and things like that the next thing that was going to happen apparently was I would have to progressed on to New York to corporate level and I really found that I had an awful lot of difficulty dealing at a level with a great many people and I was dissatisfied with that possibility and I want up going to work for the Harlem Globetrotters for getting into broadcasting at that time with Globetrotter communicate and I must order you a lesson I went in as general manager of the Globetrotters to radio properties in Cleveland Ohio WIC C & W D okay which were two very successful radio stations and a year after I went into Cleveland if we came to a neat agreement they agreed to stop paying me and I didn't stop working for unemployment and I've managed to maintain 12 years of unemployment has run away run away music station Jeff Davis put that up there I thought you don't want to catch us a joke tell us a joke about obviously so sorry about that but this is a whole different situation it's like I mentioned earlier I can remember many times in my moves across the country that I got fired a lot driving the U-Haul in the only thing you could pick up in the morning was wls7 the 27th cup of coffee and really it was a good friend of the middle the night going to the Tennessee mountains when you're our guy lives we get real heavy and all that stuff put together before we go back to music you know there are a bunch of people right now driving across this country in Kansas and Oklahoma listening to whatever what day is it find the next Blast from the Past that'll be the peppermint twist Joey Dee big radio station then we're looking at a number of guys and you're one of them and we got to stay the way they are the choices down to about three or four thousand and bike right now can we give you a few the girls later went into massage Brothers at okay hold on to the tunes mom has a comment about the jingle I just wanted to say that we recorded all these young girls down at that was Anita Kerr singers and we had such people like framer was on the piano Boots Randolph was on one of the Warrens I'll have to think on the session cost of what you're here and there is a little bit of magic that contributed also does excessive WLS count now what are you still at the gym I'm out now way Jim I want you to put a little enthusiasm into this then out of a truck that has mile from San Francisco really well at the Chicago Bears the Mormon Tabernacle Choir I think open thanks WLS sounding different it sounded exactly $35,000 and even today 35,000 lot of dough and I said who've you got any food I want you to listen to Jim and we sat in this old tub with three chairs in the studio that was the total audience of the national barn dance that you know gone the way of All Flesh and even we sent me listen to the jingles and I said they're incredible what's playing again and I think we played them about 10 times all the way through I said I've never heard anything like that because we didn't have the Nashville to cut these things and Fred's on our chief engineer went down also to make sure they were technically correct and watching her in the singers and Chet Atkins all those people and Floyd Cramer the kind of genome that play it back what a day I can do better than that in about 15 times later that damn they're all finally happy with the ticket then and then they would say to me do you like it's a you want us to do it again after these people have done it to their satisfaction what are you going to say right now because they were just great I went down one time to go to Pam's on a jingle cutting session feel like it said what what what do you call us a jingle Mill radio station Commercial Jingles for everybody and they started cutting them and every time they cut them they say well how did you like that and I'd say they're saying woss because that's the way they say that they know the call letters r w l s let go that's what was said. SeaWorld tickets for 1960 there we go turn it. Ok Google, Golden Days of radio. Let me see what happens I have a question what's your first name where you from how old is rain 50% chance of rain tomorrow height 71 I never could get that hold on radio Jiffy Lube today after going to be rain and I'll be 51° what's a Serenity pick that because that was the second record I stalled at the same time that we were playing radio right we had some fun inventive music like more than the band album and it wasn't it wasn't sure if I threw some Bruce Springsteen on Joe Klein 10 all your your uncle is right here in Los Angeles for last week the fact that here this is I had a band when I was in high school and it we were going to do a demo and a friend of mine works radio station small and Simon Alex in Heist and I told him that the studio time was ridiculous. We don't need to drop the station and we'll know do a demo for you and I the first time I saw somebody in the door in the window on the light came out he was talking to play music and I thought you had paid for this you know you're playing music in your bag of some damned good money and you're going out and doing house and then personal appearances plus you get to go to a lot of concerts in a lot of fun it's a lot of crazy stories that we weren't able to tell on the era of course tonight but such as a business the rock and roll radio is going to be happening for the balance of the weekend not with a whole group of people that we're all going to be here at 1 for me the other on Saturday and who's going to be where I don't know how I'm going to be on tomorrow morning from 7 to 10 with Larry Lujack you and I am canceling contact it isn't we're going to really go to the question about it he will be fired on the listen for that goes I certainly will be a player no more trolley of in the good old days the case may be used to an awful lot of voices and he did Alex dreier very well and he did Chet Chet Huntley and David Brinkley and what have you and one night we were sitting downstairs and London house during the Republican during the Republican National Convention in 1960 and what was in there doing his David Brinkley your chat head earlier one of you guys stop by the table to look down it's a very good young man very good and it was David Brinkley the laughing like crazy Every Good Boy.

Explain what this is and how you hurt it and why you still have it that's what amazes me is how I used to save tapes and various award things and plaques and junk like that a few years ago I took some several Hefty bags and just chucked it all so there's no reason like I always thought you were a funny man no matter what I like your sense of humor at the time that you went ahead and did this bit on the air and I'm sure enough I do still do the cheap trash can you use those reports not there I was driving into work I had announce my resignation I've resigned the day before and I was driving to work 7:30 in the morning who is PD at that time yeah I think so and the station was much into that much more music and we got to try to beat everybody in town and the only way we can do it as have the disc jockey shut up and play records don't say anything you want you got seven seconds to do it in and don't forget the call letters in the time in the temperature in your name all of a sudden the radio station around 2 and you can go on and did your trashy Showbiz report which at that time and life went on and on and on and on and on and on and on men something like six and a half for 7 minutes and when I first started and he kept going on and on and on and on I started to get that was it was going to be screaming Brent and the more I listen to funny or I thought it was in the reason I say that is because I think it's the music and besides I got my name mentioned on the air good happens in a while so I really wouldn't fire you over something like this even if I could have been I probably still could have because it was going to happen sooner or later anyways and so that's kind of that's kind of the meeting for the did that morning after I have resigned on his cheap trash me Showbiz report that I guess what we should do is probably rolling papers is thinking Call Ritchie tractor Showbiz Report with Larry Lujack well I had a couple of things here I wanted to buy Frank Sinatra for the others about Paul McCartney which job I think I'll just skip that that just doesn't seem important this morning so yesterday afternoon an official announcement was made that stunned the Showbiz Community here in Chicago the resignation of Gene Taylor as vice president and general manager of WLS I guess he just couldn't take it anymore it's going to a radio station in Cleveland I am not ashamed to admit that I wept openly upon hearing the news and that is why I'm wearing this black armband this morning nipples sob and was like a father to me especially the black armband B is a kind of plastic on my part because I level with you I'm not really that sad to see him go for a couple of reasons one I suppose I'll have a big going-away party I'll have to chip in for a present or something and another reason I'm not really that upset is because I figure it's a lucky break for me the announcement of his successor will not be made for another couple of weeks yet do I figure my time has come what was the final decision will be made by the ABC Network idiots who call the shots in New York rumor has it the only drawback so far to my selection is I'm in decision as to whether or not a general manager and vice president who wears Levi's won't harm the corporate image they always worried about the corporate image with his outfit but I am assuming I will get get the post and when I take over there are certainly going to be some changes at this radio station there are a lot of people I don't like here and there's no sense naming names you know who you are because you are first on the list I will be cleaning house there's also a couple of jocks here who had better start flooding the nation with their checks because you guys are going to get yours also there's going to be some changes in programming we're going to dump this contemporary rock and roll for Madden go full-time country and western I was Hank Snow Lefty Frizzell hey The Newsroom is a budding Buck Owens Webb Pierce those guys also we're going to have a lot of religious programming what a faith healer is Johnny are going to heal everybody that's one reason I kind of hate to see him go and that is I love to play golf with the man playing golf with Gene Taylor is just like making a deposit in my bank account is always good for at least a 50 or 75 bucks every Sunday afternoon what a pigeon is like taking candy from a baby you have never seen such a slice but I figure you know he's Cleveland isn't that far off I figured Gene Taylor is probably embezzled enough money from this company in the last 10 years he's probably set for life I figure you can probably afford to fly up here every weekend this summer and he probably will because he still thinks he can take me stupid call Josh l a little little personal note here I would like to thank you in my five memorable years at this station for paying me a lot more than I'm probably worth and I also must confess something I Dreamed a big contract has been a couple of years ago on Theater Arlington Park Towers Hotel did you really think I was going to quit oh gosh are you easily snowed sure Bluff do you on that one but thanks for the money guy thank you for putting me in this tax bracket but I suppose as the song goes someday we'll be together again so where this business is buzz when you're on top is only one place to go when it's done on and you're already headed that way in Oakley latest please is Logan some 250 W daytime or in Cheyenne or someplace it shines off at Sunset with a Merle Haggard version of The Star-Spangled Banner vaya con dios baby and maybe the good Lord bless and keep you until we meet again what year was that 1971 got to Cerberus and get passed over on the promotion ladder every time an
