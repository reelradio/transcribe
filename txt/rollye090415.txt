lunatic friends it's the Raleigh James show the time is right before that though I must say moments ago I was just about as Bond as a person could be I wasn't ready to do and I had wanted to add one of those early things on a I I like tough enough and I finally got I thought a clean CD copy cuz my 45 is well wait to say the least and so here it comes in iRacing and Ice before the show I said let me just hear a little let me hear how good it sounds you know I was talking with Uncle Ricky and you'll meet him in a moment about how CDs screw up original recordings but in my entire lifetime I have never seen them take a decent 45 and turn it into something that sounds like it's the Big Hurt by Miss Toni Fisher I do not even know how this phasing went wrong so I'll worry about that after the show but in the meantime as I say I'm thrilled about this but I'm also bummed as to the reason now I've mentioned Uncle Uncle Ricky repeatedly because of real radio real radio.com the best repository of air checks anywhere ever online or off really it is just the greatest site it's been there twenty years it predates what we know is the internet yes of course some of us were conversing online and things like that but you know this. The compy suck day is not the ww.w it's cheap and easy days and it's over 20 years this has to become a bully site and what I think is happening but I'm not sure is that we're getting old and dying Uncle Ricky said you were coming up on our 20th anniversary and it may be over that's February 14th 2016 the Uncle Ricky has lost eight hundred subscribers in the last year and you probably heard me talkin because it was all over the text sites about the riaa was involved in all this that's all worked out it's not a problem and you know text stuff for another day will leave that where it is but the bottom line is you have access right now for $10 to anything on this website which is like 3380 something different are checks and with so many people like Kimberly who I know is listening who loves the disaster takes it home we're going to play some of these don't worry about that but for 10 it is the best listening experience ever and if your Mac person like me and you saved files Uncle Ricky was kind enough to give us a link to an old real player that is just Divine it loads instantly and it doesn't ask you for updates at updates and everything else every 5 minutes so this is really easy to listen to and the only problem with it is once you start your free time is going to evaporate because you will be in front of the computer I can guarantee it and so with Uncle Ricky welcome to the Raleigh James show wow what an introduction thanks thanks very much and things to discuss and you ain't going nowhere so I appreciate the well the only person is still stuns me that there is in any way a dearth of subscribers I will say that when I first happened on the site I was listen to the scope of checks and you and I had talked and you mentioned about while you know we've recreated chicks were the Fidelity's there and I got to tell you it first I thought well so here's what happened I was working on another project that was labor-intensive and so I thought it almost the top 40 drops I don't want to hear her but I found Jim Runyon from 1965 in Cleveland and I thought I'll just put this on and it was not it was a full are check into that and working I got it exactly as if I was listening to the radio in Cleveland in 1965 this is from real and we have them from all over the country and from many many different years so it's your little Charlotte North Carolina we have we probably have to go to Charlotte the two-lane asphalt road called Radio Road station they added on to it because they had a staff at like 233 sales people the section on there to handle all that and persistence Tans office has them and I think they gave Jack Antonoff is 250 that's where I worked was the original little building that was just the control room with the transmitter behind the glass that such an incredible signal you could listen to big waves on the beach in South Carolina and there's something that permeates these buildings and some of them were damn near death traps I mean big ways was a palace compared to some of them but what's interesting is the magic that was made in those hallways some of those stations would later moved really classy Diggs and you know I can't think of any case that happened where the station sounded much worse than what it was in the dump so much better and more than once I did when I used to have those dishwasher detergent pellet that you could just dump I throw it right in the water and wait for the sides and it was just Cold Springs so I think it's fine when you're in a building where the ceiling tiles are falling on your head transmitters at the gate the water was circulated through an outdoor pool that was a very unusual radio station because it had and it didn't go very far in land but all the way from Jacksonville up through the Carolinas that station that had a powerful power and it was also well known for the it's Heidi which is from the year was at the nervous norvus Records face cuz I don't know if you got a chance to be great making a discovery that or and you and I both know what it is and it'll come up most people listening to radio today think that radio back in the day and especially boss radio the real Don Steele at all was very regimented and structured and in many people's mind I think about the same stop sets and then listen to a check and you find out that way minute what they're doing with the commercials is there highlight in like they would the music and what's fascinating to me is that the commercial go to the music are you are you know I've I've really it bothers me a lot because I don't watch a lot of TV I try to watch him nothing something to get an idea of what was going on but I don't hear a lot of these big production numbers on the on the radio and if the commercials anymore and you go back to the to the late sixties and seventies and you hear these incredible I mean I think people are familiar with the the Coca-Cola General Zod hundreds and hundreds of jingle performed by recording artist and and Pepsi also had a wonderful none of that Wrigley's Spearmint Gum had jingles and ran for years and years and years and deeper all really well for new species of audio they offered it for castration and they were recorded in the best studios in the in the big cities and featured some of the some of the greatest singers I AM and PM also sang on Commercial cracks of course so that's one of the things that I really missed from Radio there but one of the most popular background tracks or commercial now it's just some guy with me but you're right for a while it was especially in the mid-sixties every pop act and got a commercial and I don't have it chewed up but my favorite of course is probably the Iron Butterfly for ban roll-on you know talk about sequitur but what was interesting in this was also how some of them were dated now today in this era when we think about products we very often worry about health risks and I don't think I'd start with this but I got it I came across this in the running are check I just I just lost it I don't know who in their right mind would sell a 10/10 there you go no deposit no return team can do lighter weight that's the nice thing about soft drinks in can do their stackable packable you never go back about a no deposit no return United Way to use days when you refrigerate a free way to buy your favorite soft drink is in a cat I just I just think that's hilarious and the value of these are they represent is the culture of the time and Anna can we can really understand how quickly how radically in some cases that culture is changed in 50 60 obviously uses those older your check you in lots and lots of cigarette commercial construction sites do you know that's good have been buried under Earth for 20 years now I don't even know what candy is anymore do they do is anybody even make it to the extent has made an aluminum actually two cheaper than aluminum to this day there was a time when it was considered to be a precious metal not bought any of us were alive but long long time ago music for food the problem is in both cases that the items are somewhat toxic they both leave each but there is an argument as to what year when you think about it does the does the plastic leach more than what time does the bleach more than the aluminum who the hell knows but in no case today are we selling a plastic or metal container as a plus back we don't we don't want you drinking the product at all that sugar in it so precisely his jockeys who were totally interacting as I say with the commercials doing a ton of live commercials and it was important for and I don't know if it is anymore but I know that back then one of the things you had to be able to do what you had to be able to cold spot Play 60 seconds go so one of the reasons we used to hire this Jacquees and radio announcers is to read those radio commercial and the only guys that make up his spot fly and so do all the other guys that have their own radio show, but you don't hear a lot anymore on a music station because other than morning drive there's nobody physically in the building or something else goes back I don't know if 30 years now go back to the 80s and some juncture in the oven in the evolution of contemporary Hit Radio where it wasn't it an appropriate for the announcer to speak without some sort of background so if he had to read the live spot here's the background track because we can't cross mileage Armstrong air checks from WKBW in Buffalo for folks who haven't heard Jack it's an absolute treat enunciate every word and I'm going to compare him to wmar here in a minute you know where this is going but before we even do that when you listen to show on cable you make a real discovery about live read tomorrow you come in at 1:30 or close out or went through your mind it's a bit is a Real Fashion Center how many calories covid-19 all the charter school and workshop downtown Roseburg location tomorrow or not which to me is awesome to think about a fifteen-minute segment brought to buy a sponsor that's requiring a live read in between every record and this was the number one night jogging Buffalo oh yeah oh yeah I know that was that was all that was all very much the way it was supposed to be I remember the same thing with the with my favorite night time talking and in Concord which was a Long John Silver on Detroit and the Clutter very very odd thing that as we push to make radio more and more about music we really lost all that personality and all and all the valid entertainment and entertainers that used to be between the record yes so I guess you know what can I tell you if they're there now you have on your homepage on your homepage of who's hot who's not what are checks are being downloaded and stuff are checked when it just Jackie is successful he's going to have imitators and the amount of people who imitated Jack Armstrong is astounding what are we please I say the number of people who try to imitate he had taken a complete leave on Saturday in hiring because I think if you were listening to hear every word he said it might be the problem the problem and he sometimes got so caught up in himself I think that he surprised himself cuz it was he was all like the Rainy wall all completely right off the top of his mind at the moment and he eat. He make himself laugh and it wasn't it wasn't because he was supposed to be laughing it was because his mind was going in these areas and he was just even just be loading at all and every word but then forget it and destroyed it you can follow what he's doing but if you start thinking about what he saying you'll never catch up very it's amazing the way the way his mind works in fact when you work for John Rook encouraged him to smoke pot before shift big believer in personality and you know he when he had the opportunity he always hired some really outstanding people hyper John was like go to drugs to something it down a couple levels and I had heard the worst but later became a human being was kind of an AC duct a normal person but everybody has Emma Emma Walker pop adult through all the various machination Supply and this is what you called mother's music you know it's Mother's Day and you know you can on Real Radio you can hear how to go to the hot hits format in the first place so they were beautiful before they change format before my Joseph came in and said let me make your number one attributional eapol in Los Angeles occasionally somebody woohoo love the station would die at some point in time and in their will they would leave a radio with the station I was actually true akpol somebody left for you no money for batteries and all that and I always wondered here's a guy who inspired by butt holes to have a clue what he might be saying what's the real story is about On A Night Like This I kind of got the feeling he was doing the weather but the weather was so that's real radio is loaded with the stuff and again if you want to listen to it as a live full radio show it's clear you don't have to do the excerpts like we are you can hear the whole thing and do something 1983 woman passed away I know that when we first started up the site there was one guy who kept insisting their soft body grew out of country it was country music that made the original hits on the on the Top 40 chart others never quite the gut the fact that all top 40 was not rock and roll that there was a lot of popular songs and R&B song on top 40 radio and from the late 50s early 60s someone who appreciates 1983 radio because but you know that was only about thirty years ago was our R&B soul the soul jocks particularly if the mid-60s do you know before they they actually had a message I never went for messages and with the one that is at really captured my heart which horrible True Confession I guess and shows age but again was recorded could you pick up are you calling ship-to-shore that I don't think I've ever had one of those you better not your skipper 12th East and Northeast winds 15 to 20 knots I don't know what's the name of it I don't know I'll

Jones know what I was listening to that I dropped suppose that because Jim is very fluid in it for folks who the voice might sound very familiar to you but you don't know the name of course he was part of a chicken patties everywhere everywhere I don't think there's anybody who doesn't remember that voice and I think I think also in general you are listening to something there that is very very much different from today's culture and in fact the contrast between leave The Byrds record and everything else to happens and I have not even including the Tom Jones record because you know a lot of people don't consider that rock and roll matter it was all the mor stations and later in that same aircheck he's playing It's Not Unusual by Sammy Davis jr. fascinating to me and I just I never get tired of it is that contrast you think hearing with the very very practiced and professional presentation that was so common in the early sixties basically grew out of Television Network radio and it just very very precise professional predictable kind of of of performance and all of yours with rock and roll music I don't think people you know really can make that connection it's so if you play just the record and then we followed by Jim Runyon they say what kind of awful station is in a 10 for me I'm like what kind of awful record is that why is that exactly era of the pronoun sir like the news guy the email associated real people who can barely conjugate a verb but it's interesting because we think about in the Jim Runyon days in the mor days of just that that slick you know pronunciate a professional sound in in your happened upon Don Sherwood and Jack party and San Francisco and Don was the Undisputed morning leader as you well know of San Francisco and come to the station been in St Louis and had done a wonderful job but they were right there at the Fairmont Hotel and launched across the street and drink lunch and then come back and I just read the whole thing is on real radio.com so if you want to hear it you can I just thought this was priceless leaving you if you live in San Jose or Santa Clara County Oakley Oakland in Sunnyvale California United Airlines. connecting fares everyday what I said For What helicopter telephone the number to call for 75050 where's a great dress up your vegetables with a Sprite flavor Anthony Rich butter and egg

Galesburg and he's a rich red wine that makes beef taste be fear in spaghetti becomes a real party meal what is trepidation mean I still live without further probably 30 times that I will inspired in fact supposedly Dom Sherwood inspired the hiring of dr. Don Rose later on kfrc because his corny humor yeah so I'm so impressed the what do I redeem it so I just got completed just died recently too but he was one of the great crew and he was in charge of kfrc and in the doctor Don was in qxi of Atlanta and doing a goofy cornball humor and he just thought it would be perfect for San Francisco for 20 25 30 dr. Rose in terms of in terms of that for for the radio inside of a lot of the through those of us who were particularly long of tooth but whenever people are talking about are checks you know the other side of concept A Boss radio it has to rear its head somewhere in that and there's nobody who is a radio fan who had some point mentioned the real Don Steele and as I say when I on Real Radio just picked up random one of the tapes brought back what I knew so well but what I don't think people today realize that boss radio sounded like firstly I don't think they had a clue what the music really was nor do I think they understood the format and how it was formatted so I know you'll have a lot to say about that Uncle Ricky and probably better than both of us what's the temperature you feeling compartment if the sun burned it to with dark tanning sea & Ski lotion or oil clouds in the morning hours and stuff like that and some sunshine. oil call Lacey Milwaukee Wisconsin set out to discover what he's really like along the way we asked him what he thinks about shopping the new products Supermarket wish I had one of everything true story on Bose radio get old ancient texts STP oil treatment keep your car running Racers shocking the best way to recognize the dog and cat food made from afternoon Moody Blues. I don't think that's the way most people remember it well you know it was all the commercials were clustered it more so than the music actually that the second you displayed which somehow seem to work yeah go in and in most cases if they were you're not talking 122nd to talking with talking 90 seconds tops 6:30 maybe a very very important but you know the other thing that I ask myself we ever get to the point where we needed 5 minutes honey what happened to the music industry where it was enough just to have two and a half three and a half minutes of a you know some clever lyrics and a nice course for 5 or 6 minutes at a dilemma in the later sixties it was a horrible dilemma actually as you were starting in many markets to see they what were then underground and Progressive stations you were hearing all these album cuts that you are never going to going to play what started to happen when a top 40 station got records in the mail is that they had an awful lot of bubble gum I mean how many times can you play jam up and Jelly Tight that you had a ton of Herobrine tambourines of the world and all that and so if you didn't want to be all them all the time you were going to go softer and Blacker another words people listening to Atlanta radio listen to probably name five records by The Marvelettes listening to Springfield and it wasn't Jeff the rock group that did not chat chart naturally well that all this is Luke maybe I understand what you were saying that because I was surprised when I heard those songs from the Sarah check and I guess you know that stuff I was going to pick you up this ain't very same time but what was was also true when I got a chance to listen to some other Los Angeles air checks was what was the other one the Bretton Woods song of his problem is but I'm saying the Bretton Woods song because it was so what I'm saying is that people may have a misconception of what worked musically in Los Angeles it it really wasn't all Beach Boys and M in rock and roll there was an awful lot of wind in the popular music scene in Los Angeles but what was interesting you mention the music of course what was that they misjudged the Beatles here come the Beatles and they must be jocks are now middle-aged guys and they made fun of them well well let me tell you do understand Carol I didn't have a license of course it was operating under the foundation but you be goofed on the Beatles jumped on that like white on rice but then they you know they made Dave hold a hullabaloo are the fifth Beatle every Market they really did well enough to drown now what happened is by the time food in May of 65 betting their success on British Invasion and here comes caged and everybody remembers the type production and all the jocks and all but they don't realize that if you parts that playlist went back to LA so I 65% black and that's what Carol a wasn't playing you know one of our contributors who's been involved from the very beginning with with the real Don Steele collection and Sean Steele and materials in Cumberland has a wonderful kxj chart archive and it's something you should check out Randolph is the guy and yes it's the this is a weird URL Flash Builder the big the big 93 Bible and it takes you to that that particular official khj lost 30 I'm just looking at the one who was caught up in the top is humble Harve humble are the 93 cage so he think he's really quite amazing so that is a site that you can be lost in 4 hours as well site there is a fella in Miami who has one for 2 a.m. and they're supposed to die in Cleveland do us one for which city in the list list make this link work and go ahead and put it on both the Raleigh. Net and also on box collection one of the things we did when he was a little blue box and says 93 kha boss 13 online beside the number of the exhibit is where ever you see that little blue box it says 93 khk bus 30 online if you click that it brings up a little a little pop-up box that has the number for the exhibit the position of the debut of the song and the peak of the song and the number of weeks it was on the bus right and these these songs are specific to the aircheck where that little blue box is supposed to be I hope that makes sense but the point is that it doesn't show you all the songs you can play in the air check but it does show you how the songs that were on the cage gave us Thirty charted a course if people will just pay $10 for god sakes that's all it is through the end of all through February 14th about it you know people love to talk and and we know this because I know if it does your broadcast journalist and night you were running a big-time block now so but it's but it's but it's very very important if it's only fair that the actual evidence of what occurred is made available you know I can conceivably I have a huge stash of things that I've collected over try to use your I-Pass people to send it for people to send them to me and they did and we've had a lot of fun, and we've had you know lots of people tens of thousands of people have come and gone but the fact of the matter is if it's if it's going to continue to be available to the public there has to be active support because they're a licensing issues and there are maintenance issues of course I would really love to take the site down for a year and rebuild it and bring it back on like me I'm like take these things lovingly recreate them clean them up so when someone is hearing a great audio our this represent 8 hours of your time and would have represented 8 minutes of mine but you go through and really really do this and it's all I've got Rowdy and they're always my it's my it's my work product so I know I should also mention of course 610-640-6400 if you want to talk to Uncle Ricky and if we have to pay for the phone call 8888 Raleigh rollye which is 888-876-5593. Welcome. I can't believe in the times I've called you I haven't brought up to site Real Radio I have been on that site for 20 years and it is a pack I just renewed tonight when I say cuz I've been so busy lately I haven't had the time to go on it but boy what a treasure I really encourage your listeners if they have even the minimal interest in that era was the Subscribe don't even don't even don't even bother testing and checking it just pay the ten bucks and have fun and decided constructed in such a way it's very easy to index and find everything and go back to your hometown your home radio station and see the treasures of stuff that's there in particular one thing that gave me a good education of how of the Genesis of Boss radio was your listings Ricky under kyno in Fresno word pretty much it all started you've got several what hour-long interview them there they talked about how it all started a new started it with the people that were involved in that you were the big kind of battle the battle of the big battle of Fresno Wichita Drake had one station Dracut I know and long Jacobs who later became the K-State PD was over it's really hard core and it was very interesting because do you know the one thing that Ron Jacobs stuff he learned he admitted he learned from Bill Drake one thing you play the jingles into the records oh yeah not the voice the Jingle the check the listener too and then during the commercial of course as well they should be given how they sound compared to today's commercial but the Genesis of what became boss radio and waking Atlanta the Bartell station where he was working before we went to Kya was transferred there is really where you'll see a lot of his roots and there's you no more dozen tricks where were you can see where it came from kxla in Sacramento and of course all the big guys came through I would have had the pleasure of enjoying dr. On roads during his prime incredible talent and I was going to do it too real radio like I said about 20 years ago by my friend in the business Charley Belcher thank you very much Charlie I think it's a listener Now look for you today for him to send it to him but yeah I wholeheartedly I absolutely love it and it is it's entertainment you can fit and go through it listen to the different air check and it's almost as if you're living in today for real it's a really beautifully done thank you for the thank you have a good night for you to the site and I think that's just like a donut if you know shotgun Johnny Ringo I don't know after you get out of radio became a commercial pilot as well and will you take if you absolutely if you knew shot them jumped right on real radio.com so he's giving away a winner of the wind in been great 10 prizes worth $10,000 can include you know you listen for the clothes and then you gave away five cars Joey gave away five garages and you know when it's Dan caplen tried something that I guess store got busted for it earlier years earlier when Captain came in two ways in Charlotte that he can kayle stay to the big waves treasure hunts and 1,000 bucks and eat and they actually literally had a physical Pride like a toothbrush holder with someone and then that you did that include swear it wasn't next week I'll have to pick it up it's buried somewhere in here is the clue and and people did horrible mess with people digging up all the property all over the place and yes well for New Orleans because when he moved from that Old position to to the 690 he actually donated the radio station to the City of New Orleans I think the Board of Education ultimately got it now. Did you have a chance and I knew him very very well and the other reason I knew him is so dick would always be sending me you know the conspiratorial tapes and I probably have more of that than his history of of stores and of course tell me your voice for John Deere tractor voice run a contest we had here in the family business contest were very very small town and so our contest was Globe has a family business it's called the courthouse name people who are related to each other in the person who comes up with the most names wins and in a fatherly did the promos of you know the the family business is the backbone of America and walking right in front of the courthouse in somebody one who found like 58 names but I always think of this whenever I think of what your fatherly the phone would ring I pick it up I said hello and eat a dick but I mean it's just I guess he's one of those got one of those Richards you think so because he got called Dick every Richard he was interested because of course his point of view was whb Centric and so there there's always arguments among stores along as what happened where but you know I can't take it away from him at the first annual just Jackie convention not the one that's 12 Paola hearing's better before I did contribute some some unusual things for his work on store which was eventually completed I guess but the show me videos we have experts from his origins of the top for it was a store is broadcasting the revolution from the Greek Forum at the end and there were aggressive made there and including one of those is a gentleman named Mel Armstrong who was US senator and he talks about being the first top 40 disc jockey in this was on the the 50th birthday at 5:40 in June of 2004 Video but it's and it plays on Max it's a very it's very interesting speech from this man who was there you was playing in the end that's where it started ladies and gentleman and you know we still haven't been able to convince Claude Hall that it wasn't on the back of a cock American Inn drawn by Bill Stewart & I in a bar one night but investigated are really quite interesting and there's an awful lot of it's an awful lot of information on the site that backs up to work that he did he was very nice to leave that stuff with us thankfully before he passed on yeah of course of history didn't happen overnight at the napkin was important but and I think that dick had some of this in his history I know he talked about the study that they bought from the University of Nebraska and Lincoln but I'll tell you what I remember from and I wasn't there in the early fifties that's for sure but the people who warned go people who were that used to talk to me the story that I heard repeatedly was that when I went I got back you know from from the war he was in World War I McLendon and that he bought kowhai which was at a time when the Omaha World-Herald sold it for $80,000 and as far as the money and it was a variety of things but this the Korean conflict broke out and one of the things that occurred to him was well why don't we do updates and she used to do what he did was a new news and an evening news on the radio and he was with someone in a beer his parents into beer making fun of rounds and people were talking about you know the war updates that they wanted to hear more often and so talk about 5150 to the idea of our leave or update the problem was it wasn't that interesting a war so he patted it with local news and when ended hourly news local news and they wanted it and so when the apocryphal story which did happen with the waitress in the March quarter in the Jukebox that we all know most people don't realize that he already had the experience with news of the idea of repetition know you do it grew from a number of places but no it wasn't it wasn't you know when a bar that night for the first time it happened by by any means and Stewart was around as well to know about the war update so it didn't occur to them I don't think until the Jukebox story and for folks who don't know a waitress in a bar is going to hear the same records over and over if they're popular the end of the night she took a quarter out of her purse that was not a mark jukebox water meaning it was from her tip money and she played the same records and when you think about that really what that did was kind of a lock experience of my God repetition in the news they want repetition in the music to and spoke with what I believe instigated the top 40 for the major change and it was also the fact that radio stations with decoupling tickly the small independent station where decoupling from the national Radio Networks and there was also a big shift in what happened to radio listening after the sun went down and we're we're other things that television did to influence what radio did even though it may not have seen that way at the time when you look at it culturally it really was a major change at one point. you know what's good the family entertainment spice and then one day Dad brought home the new TV that was a big deal. I remember it's remembered well and the television repair shop in the window so what what it did the radio and what helped spawn the revolution is for the independent these are stations that weren't decoupling they never were they were just nineteen sixty something but for the independent these stations were worthless and you know when it's undeniable that stores and Stuart debuted what they had talkto. What on that wtix in the wall and so they had bought and they pay $25,000 for that was to lose that's when you're creative and that's that's why Network radio. Cuz it held on to that block program through all of the other thing as you well know what was happening is music was going through a revolutionary change and that make no just like when CHR came back in the 1880s the music changed so what you were saying is the pop standards were giving way to a cross between rhythm and blues and rockabilly / country and all that and and hear Here Comes rock and roll and it was it was perfect and your parents hate it even better yep yep it did no question that the music please easy major change was television and music because when people actually saw Elvis Presley then we got a problem it was it was one thing to have that track blowing out of the radio but if you had to go home and watch it at night and see this guy shaking his head to a man that's really crossed the line now, Thornton who did the original sound like you 50 for everybody talks about American Bandstand was Bob Horn and it started in 1952 and some local television you really are an Oregon license to Wilmington the time in Delaware and Mitch Thomas was is a black dance show it was terrific but even with Bob Horn nobody remembers Bob what was amazing about that cuz he started the show in 52 and was really like an early almost MTV because before he got the idea of having the kids dance he was playing music videos but they are your pop standard type videos but he stayed alive from 52 to 57 and managed to bridge the move from pop standard to rock and roll amazing 5257 New Orleans wants to talk but the reason American Bandstand was in Philadelphia was well over two major reasons one was because they didn't have to pay the network you know contract Union fees at New York in Philadelphia but the other thing is triangle Publications the guy you on TV Guide Walter Annenberg he also on wfil someone ABC saw these dance shows cropping up like milk Brandon DC and Buddy Dean in Baltimore and Jean loving in Norfolk and on and they want to do one it couldn't do it anymore cuz the expense Philadelphia seem perfect because here's triangle cuz you know they had a kind of sweetheart relationship with TV Guide for the obvious reasons. moral turpitude charges and got him out of the way and pick that phone because of course I talked about a lot of my book but the reason that Alan freed was not defended and he didn't understand this was because she had to defend it Clark because their license was on the line with it back then Paola why isn't it illegal for disc jockeys perfectly legal for disc jockeys owners couldn't do it because of the Saturday night ABC Beechnut show with Dick Clark they accidentally were engaging in puggle no doubt about it had to do with an American Airlines mention and we all knew what it was I was so rude and what they realized if they didn't save Dick Clark their licenses could have gone down in flames So Long Island free but I don't think he ever I understood that their reasoning wasn't personal it was saved the licenses Hooters all you know there's always more to the story and by the way while I can still recover and I'm flashing back to me earlier time call Drew employees who who hired dr. Rosa wqxr in Atlanta and later lured him away from wfil in Philadelphia just like Paul Paul Moana he graduated from Wayne State in Detroit who really wanted to work at wake so we got an apartment in the same building that bill Drake had an apartment. It would kind of like to drink went down the pool with shifter everyday wormed his way into weight and I don't know that was really about how that happened and later of course was unfortunately not a very good friend to to bill over the years but be it as it may Paul had their both they're both of they're both dealing with those things on another dimension play that's right away from either of them that their Works were contributions you know I'm not shy about saying that you don't like when I pick up the thing I don't necessarily think we ever really focus so much on the people themselves as their contributions as to what they did I think I think radio is always been kind of a show me business it's kind of like you don't tell me about all the great things you did let me hear it and that's that's all I've tried to do is play but before I do gym is in New Orleans OG play hello Uncle Ricky hello there General Highway still see what I can do I will baby I thought they were more cooler than the time Real Radio see that's the neat thing about Real Radio. Mind is fuzzy you can go back and hear them both and then people will agree with you and my question is how can I hear radio already, go to the homepage it is text-based so I know you can't see the but certainly your reader will almost everything you have Uncle Ricky is text-based right so if you're blind you can read this right it's all pretty much 1996 we have technology but the good news is we have we have a number of a blind users and they they have no problem getting around at all Valentine's Day call fantastic and I should mention again. I got you that you care also I wanted to make sure you had some Central you had some that this 5586 you know you're very top 40 radio off now you know you know because my favorite part of top 40 radio what's coming out of them all into the old wfun form have you talked about blood coming out there was a countdown and they did and you're still chatting and they're still Shannon and you gone to heaven it is one of those great moments on the radio if people don't understand it touches certain manipulate certain things in your side you when you hear that kind of lies and excitement climaxing in a great deal Shannon song yeah that's right I think Frank Ward was brilliant I don't know if you have any of his work when he was at Sunderland but Franca in the in the sixties wound up at sonderling which had some R&B stations and he realize they just didn't sound as good and he figured out why they didn't sound as good because they were you know the pork chop in commercials and so he just didn't bother to tell Coke and Pepsi in Delta that he was running their spots they they just said that so much better than you ever get in trouble that you can't do that we're not paying for that exactly and so but it was really a brilliant move because when you think about it so many of the top 40 stations like it heavily based on their production and so he's thinking well what are you why I understand that I often bemoaned the fact that I am I getting my first job is w e g o in Concord North Carolina laws for just driveways by the three or four people that work there I mean it could get pretty dismal of time so if you could I would have loved to do that if you can make a little jingle a little song and the father doesn't care if you feel like what you said you used to sing Jingles all the time sure you know me for a while and I used to do that I can still remember carpet jingle because their address rhymed let you know what I mean I I would just do it to the tune of Dixie or Papa Gene's blues or anything and I didn't matter make but sure I made them sing and in fact our public affairs gal was Sally Jessy when she was starting out and her husband and her husband Karl was the nicest guy what's up incredible Yankee Jim's now the other side of this again is while it's obviously a vocation and a vocation and an absolute labor of love if enough people don't sign up for this this is in danger of going away and that's what scared the hell out of me that's why we're talkin tonight it's fine it's just been a long road and some people would say after 20 years we've done all that we need to do and it's done you know there are I can't tell you how many and maybe maybe you can but I can't tell you how many radio archives museum Tradio museums there are all over the country in big cities and small and in private collections just never get heard right it's one thing to say we have a great collection of air checks but you can't hear them that best you can hear s s of them if you push the button and stand in the hallway somewhere so this is the thing that always bothered me about something that you seem to be so obvious right from the beginning I've been in the internet about 1 year and this this thing called really audio came along and I said what do I have that I might want to come I'm looking at the closet full of tapes and it just it just seemed to me to be such an obvious thing because this was something that was perfect perfect for an electronic based Museum archive play me jack off and it really did I mean for the first ten years it was free I had full-time employment elsewhere and I just stayed up late and work on weekends and do whatever I could to update it every week and I get updated every week for very little only a few exceptions when I didn't it it was working very well until I reached the point where I needed I needed compensation to keep working on it because the bigger it got the more work it took there was more stuff to maintain and so after 10 years then we said $12 a year and it was it was $12 a year in the first year that works out really well in the second year there was a little bit of a drop the third year after that we're talkin you know 2008-2009 2010 I would say about the time we got to 2011 we were looking at the probably 50% of what we had just five years previously because once once people started paying for it they listen to what they wanted to and then they felt like I just don't I don't want to pay for that again cuz I've already heard it and it may be that maybe that's what went wrong with the plan but it is a sad thing to see that there's a little support for now because it just doesn't it doesn't have what are the licensing cost for us or the beer is the the archive the archival of this material is is extremely large now yeah. Yeah me nervous. I have boxes and boxes and boxes and I'm so many CD sleeves and DVDs in mini discs and that takes and takes because I've kept all the originals everything that's been sent to me and you know this is a valuable collection of taking a long time to create the help of many many many many wonderful people who loved it and cared about it many of them are still with the site but a lot of those who were with us earlier have either forgotten or are unable to access the internet anymore from the other side of the trail literally I mean that's one of the things that's the fallacy of well I've heard it all is what is to fold number one besides always evolving no one's hurt at all stuff is always coming there number two is that for 10 bucks a year to keep this alive I can't imagine anyone who has a fondness for radio not thinking that that is a good deal I consider this and other resource and you know the reality is probably get to hear as much in this year cuz I got a lot to do but I am so grateful it's there and now that you turn me on to the idea of I can just you know stream one of them that's a full-length tape while I'm doing accounting or something I realized but have you ever tried her mobile service yet people forget that if you don't want to listen to K is when you drive to work in the morning you can always you know bring up a real Don Steele aircheck 1968 let me know if that's an hour-long it's how long it'll take you to get to work yeah that's that's really about it works for both apple and not not all not all of our exhibits are available to mobile but many of them are and as we go along more and more of them will be and of course as we go along with the qualified statement because I don't know if we're going to go along you know I always offered annual renewal years I've offered annual renewal and when I started offering a 6-month renewal obviously I got a few people who have what happens after November 14th then I said I don't know of the February 14th I don't know you know I don't know I don't know it's going to depend on if we don't have sufficient support to pay our music renewals rrt renewals at the first of the year in the last 2 months of this idle just Bistro care checks there won't be any unskilled there Jacksonville yeah that's another fallacy that a lot of people for a variety of psychological reasons believe that everything I'll I should be free and that's a that's a wonderful except that it costs to do something like this even forgetting about your time involvement like you say your music rights fees your Broadband for use your you know where we are keeping this stuff server fees that adds up now when people hear that you're asking everybody safe her $10 and there is no way that you're you're you're not getting rich probably not going out to dinner on it you're just keeping yourself afloat letting it pay for itself and I don't think that for anybody who likes radio that that's a lot to ask for I I would think that everybody should contribute to this I would like I would like to celebrate 20 years online and I think that's a reasonable reasonable expectations because I work for it for the last 20 years and I wish I was online before Microsoft at a browser before there was YouTube Before Their what's Google for there was Facebook I was on for years before any of those things existed and I think that it would be reasonable for me to get to my 20th anniversary which is next February 12th 2016 you know I'd like to I'd like to do that I think that's the reason for all the people who have supported the sites and then and then engage with a site over the years and this is a time now or you should come in and say you know we want to get there to get there we want to say we been online for 20 years very few sites can say that yet and so we have we have an opportunity to make a little history with our little history radio sites and 9 that's all I'm asking for and I don't think that now is that not unreasonable I would think that again anybody who considers themselves a fan of radio who is not supporting this is no fan of radio at all sure we can go online and find airchecks on YouTube where you can find air checks on like you say some of the historical sites for one thing they usually will be sculpt or a very often there is from somebody's collection where they had a Norelco a cassette player close to the radio the quality is abhorrent to clean him up to put them together and of course to put more than 3,300 in one place but when we first talked I had said look I need something that's a disaster tape because Kimberly who listen to all the time loves of the disasters you know she adored take it away Chuck mchaley from speak and it was it's a late but not a shame in any event who sent you a tape of a sales guy recording his own spot now with this in mind we should probably say and I want to say this as strongly as I've ever said anything as strongly to you on the radio ever yeah you know what's coming and if I buy the Way You Lie handed this to me in person buy four letter words in any way if you are faint of heart turn off the stream now if you're listening to the download the podcast if you're listening live to the stream I don't care turn it off for the minimum of 12 minutes turn off the radio please this is going to get mad if this offends you do not listen to this I think that's about as strongly as I can make that tastes with that in mind the sales guy recording his own spot is always a bad idea but as you pointed out with this this is a guy who it one point was in need of shall we say anger management with Adam. No we don't and we don't know who the guy is but Lee swears that it was an actual filters don't for a minute it's an actual sales person and of course the payoffs that you will hear is the job walks in and doesn't in one take but without your mind here is a sales guy I want to know about the beginning of it is you can tell he has all the authority of the world is going to go in there and knock out his spot in one take this is not going to be any problem let's get these levels the same here testing one two three testing okay okay what are you going to do first. Turn out okay here we go theater presents the famous epic The Ten Commandments the greatest family entertainment ever filmed by Paramount the inspiring story okay let's try it again here do you have to remember what to do if your seat okay that's there okay now right now that thing is on there so you need to talk a little bit too much theater presents the famous the greatest family entertainment ever filmed by Paramount the inspiring story of Moses to the promised land where's the where's the people at they're half better in this hello hello okay may be here forever fact the Rogue theater presents the famous epic The Ten Commandments the greatest family entertainment ever film by Paramount be inspiring story of Moses leading God's people to the promised land the film for the commandment the greatest film the Rogue theater presents the famous epic The Ten Commandments the greatest film the Rogue theater presents the famous The Ten Commandments the greatest family entertainment ever filmed by Paramount inspiring story of Moses leading God's people to the promised land that's building for the Christmas season.

There's no need for it okay now the Ten Commandments by Cecil B Demille production of scope and starring Charlton Heston and Baxter Anne Baxter let's see here we are. Maybe what I'm thinking is another man do the spot for right now Johnstown yeah okay John you'll say starring Charlton Heston and they can't get their words or anyting for the cast of Falcon Baroque theater in presents the famous Epic film by Paramount desert on one take now the part I'm sure it occurred to you to Charleston Heston every time it never occurs to him that that's a problem gets back to right before it's time to go to gymnastics just there's I think that there's a reasonable argument that some of that with Stage but on the other hand it just seems so ridiculous that it's so true to life because I know I've been there and of course I I came into that a little into the game because I didn't want it to take forever but the bottom line is that this poor guy down in the process but the thing that I also couldn't understand please in a in a control room with with enough ability to have multiple tracks I mean he's running a couple record why do you think you could edit this you know I get it's hard to say I do know that from the original cassette that Lee gave to me I cut off some debt are there was only toward the end he keeps repeating the same thing over and over there was a minute while I just started packing out those people and we ended up with a much tighter presentation for the end so there's nothing else I'd guess I guess in all fairness we have to say I didn't have to ask you about that I assume that because the guy didn't suddenly get better at finding that finding the cut. Got to get it like I think it's probably let me know like I said there's a reasonable argument baby it's not but it's probably the real thing and what's so funny you know is what is the content itself I mean it's the Ten Commandments of Moses and the people the people were overshadowed him saying is when you listen to the guy who comes on at the end that's very talented guy and that's not a good to me let me know if that would like a professional guy so I don't think this was necessarily a small radio station I just think this was a and Aaron news guy you know I mean it that way radio station we know they're just the failed guys it really want to be in the area and they'll take a knee no you're 100% right because then he represent he he he resists all yet who he thinks has an easy fun job and he's going to go out and sell so now he's going to get some of the glory record his own spot and Albuquerque and will be wrong but it's about that site they mentioned the name of the Taft and I told him and he's nowhere to be so you know we don't even know if John path with John Cass real name so that you could research all the stations where Lee Sims work though he may have just gotten it at any of those station from somebody work somewhere else because I think he worked at thirty-three different radio stations on Real Radio, including previously the video of the Phoenix around the mid-nineties is the only video of Sleeping anywhere Lee did not like to be videoed he thought it was a distraction and shot shotgun Tom Kelly shut the inside and everything and we just we he cooked a marvelous lunch we had salmon and Truffles and broccoli and an heirloom tomatoes and and a nice bottle of wine and and just just sat around and talked all day the sun started going down and I said we'll leave I haven't recorded everything he said good he handed me the state on the way out and said shotgun Tom Kelly did this I didn't want him to do it but he showed up one day with all his recording equipment and I couldn't say no given all the way out from San Diego to Phoenix then he just couldn't deny him so that's the only known recording video recording in shotgun loves video as you well know he's got a garage in San Diego that used to be outfitted to be the one hundred percent replica of The Tonight Show and hapless disc jockeys would wind up on that so he he had video in his blood from the beginning but it's just it just great stuff and it's all on Real Radio. Calm and I have no idea how many people subscribe to a podcast on how many people listen to download but I do know that those that do tend to be just died of old radio fans and if you're not spending ten bucks on this you're doing the industry of the service let alone yourself because this needs to stay alive well and also we don't want people to know that we're dad's you know we don't want them to think that because we had a misunderstanding last summer that the for some reason we're just completed the table now and there's nothing here worth listening to because it's not true there's plenty and there's a lot of lot of grapes I mean by Justin I'd Raleigh played things that I'd forgotten about it completely. You're right yeah they're there so it's it really is something that you really care about weight what radio am about the great personalities with great radio stations Great shingles everything that made it a wonderful experience for you growing up then I think that you will very much enjoy this grown-up version of those Fantasy Land of the grey radio need a PayPal account but if you got one you can just do that right on the beginning of the site that tells you where to sign up so it's no muss no fuss and it's just as easy to listen to the videos we have people every year to pay with check believe it or not but it'll still be there earlier John was saying to me cuz he knew that I was close to check Riley who was Chuck Dan before they said WIBC you know during the time that we work together so just don't care who it is there's not many people you won't find you'll find someone back in the day who you've got a more recent are Chekov and my heart just breaks when I hear it is like oh no I don't want to hear that 71 I'm like oh my God no please of course I'm saying is well past his prime when he was that you'll find somebody sitting right in their Prime and it's just it's just a joy to to put on and listen to and when you wrote to me and said you were having any trouble at all with subscribers I was I was stunned and I said well we got to do a show because I also do you know what I wonder if that needs any help with one point tonight that I am nonprofit organization licensed in California approved by the IRS when you contribute any amount of money to us whether you have access or not it's considered either insubstantial and is tax deductible and if you contributed over $200 a year we send you acknowledge bent and obviously that's completely tax-deductible to so it's you know you can give their lot of places you can give $10 to give to the Salvation Army myself a very good outfits but something else if they need your help I think if you care about this kind of radio my my interest in this has been sincere from the and I just hope that we can continue to make it available in there but that doesn't mean you can't just like for every ten bucks to be hard to come by but for people that maybe it's not as hard to come by especially if you're looking for any charitable causes whatsoever if you're coming up the end of the year saying I need to donate well what better place than this I can't imagine it that's one of the reasons that were still here Raleigh I'm sure there are some people who are in a well-heeled who can say okay I can really donate to this and that's great but especially for the people who hard to believe in this day and age that there's anybody who can afford ten bucks to be able to listen to these other checks till February 14th I've also I just I don't I don't understand I get them somewhere else and I just wondering if the qualities miss you and the quantity and all that something as conveniently laid out as this there is no other place you're going to find anything remotely like that so even if you can go through and say I can find you know an air check of anybody leave some somewhere else yeah but not in the way you'll find it real radio are the descriptions we can get into that but when you when you decide on what you want to hear and yet you know you click on it you get a couple describing the air check and some of those descriptions in and of themselves are just Priceless most of them all of them but some of them really a great why would you keep coming back to the site where we don't have little white buttons or anything we don't believe in like what you say what you want to say and you ended and it's tied to the exhibit so if you listen to Ron Jacobs on ke Kua if you want you want to say something about it she that's what the cage jtd sounded like I had no idea if you want to do that you can do about that we've always allowed comments we were doing comments like I said before Microsoft Microsoft had a browser by the time it is, but I know there was no YouTube no no there wasn't and some of it's also informed the Nightwolf we played before from wmar you know you mentioned that he's Pete Michaels and then it was later paired with his wife Brenda beset the Syracuse Morning Show on things like things ready to go get the very first we also have like there's a comment but there is a comment from the lake Robert W Morgan and I can't tell you you know I every time I see that it's just a very short comment and it's the the biggest station Ron Jacobs ever worked out with a Union 76 typical kind of these guys did all their lives what can you say how much is that worth just to keep available just to have there just to know that that was all the CC Morgan still cracking jokes in the last couple of months of his life well any other thing of course is that the site meant a lot to him because he left us all came from the family he was able to but you don't click on an Air check-in laugh or whatever so it should and I would hope people would take advantage of that while it's here but it's pretty it's got to be you know we talked about a lot of the Big Jack's tonight but even the people you remember who were a blip on the radar you'd be surprised how many of them you know whether it's the slim one on WLS so whoever you've got people that you normally aren't thinking about that are are all over this site it's true we do you know swim guide I'd never I met her once but I never went I met her I'd never heard any of her to work she apply for job at Cruyff m in Sacramento on my boss didn't want to hire her because she smoked 1982-d things were different but I'm just I'm just saying that I only realized later you know who I actually met that day but we were text we have a very special it's just just to show you how weird Americans are the two of the three me of three hours of slim on a really good after we complete beautiful stereo and the guy who recorded them recorded them on VHS tape VHS i530 okay and he he traveled to the United States to make recordings of American radio stations well here's a guy who cared yes you know I think there are quite a few people in this country who cared about the radio that's been here but I also know there's a lot of material that hasn't been submitted to think that also bothers me very sad to see things that were committed and they've been copied and then traded and made available to other places you know well yeah but the good news is and there are people who do that no doubt about it but I know anyone I hope I get to know you real quick story when I first started this site back in 1996 there was a guy out in Hawaii I never knew who he was what it was all about but opened up a second you open up a a coffee campsite he Not only was he linking to my audio exhibits he was linking to my descriptions the whole layout everything except it was him that was running a tight and even copied my bio and that was his bio before I update the site this week tell me what fortunately you went away very quickly talk to him thank you don't think you're going to be found coffee Berry Tire websites work that takes less worried about someone copying my work that if they did it long term this is somebody who is certifiable I guess I just have to believe and I said this to you and you mentioned that the subscribers were dwindling I have to believe that if enough people are aware that it is even a possibility that this site is in trouble I might go away because there are not sufficient subscribers at $10 when we all say well what's going to happen when we're gone this is a good hunk of history about about our Lives who knows more for some less for others but none the less it and I don't care what you listen to the radio and the 50s 60s 70s 80s 90s there is some of your history right here you bet Pizza its face really really unusual that this amount of commercial and and widely available I mean they don't like they do on the American public and Commercial over-the-air radio over the last 40 50 years isn't considered a gold mine of America I mean we all know about the you know what is the Golden Age of television and then the AFI does a tremendous job with Incredible Motion Pictures of been saved for posterity these recordings of American radio were made by people who had little cassette recorders are real the real recorder either works at the radio station was never any official way to say even to enter in to make sure that they will deserve many radio stations when they're sold the old tapes it laying around or filling the dumpster in the back and some of our contributions have come from those very actions and you know of course as always reuse so you might think you were getting the Buddy Tucker evangelism hour but it could have been one the best air checks you ever dug out of trash has this Congress it's something I've never considered I didn't know whether the Library of Congress would be interested here's the here's the problem with the Library of Congress they really can't take the website as it is they can't do anything with with the files that I had they they certainly can't stream any of them cereal probably not even the scope material because of how concerned the government can't get involved in that so I guess about the Library of Congress in the museum of broadcasting in Chicago and New York and wherever else if you're not making this material available online what are you doing I mean what's the sense of this stuff piling up at a warehouse somewhere makes no sense to me at all and screening your calls he was one of The Originators of cube with the one or television interactive cable project in the 70's has a DVD volumes of the programming and the New York museum was all over it and so he got a copy of every one of them to them but you're right you won't see him online you're only seeing if you were a former employee and you can get to one of his sights that's got it you know but you're actually right they don't have a repository where they put that online as yet no I don't know if you go to these various locations if you know if there's a listening room where you can go request the tapes and see them or hear them I have no idea how they work on the premises but you know if I go to YouTube I can certainly can do is try years ago you could even do a 10 years ago but if I go to episode did Rod Serling original Twilight Zone available but you know if if I was interested in hearing Rod Serling doing us the PFA in Chicago in 1972 there's only one place you can get that a great defensive to all these these proud of broadcasters who think they dumped so much it's not it's just it doesn't seem fair it isn't fair but it has pretty much been relegated in general yeah I remember the first billboard convention I hosted some because of the hunting and Sheridan and some guy and older guy not associate with the convention just gets out of his limo and he's like what what is this and I said it's a radio convention and I'll never get to see little kind of sniffed and said radio isn't that past tense and it clearly wasn't I think there's a lot of people who who viewed radio certainly top 40 radio I mean as you well know if they wanted to do voiceover they had to get off the top 40 station whether it was a Gary Owens or a or a rubber Tony Morgan because expect for what as you pointed out earlier is really a sociological for some in this is it this is truly the history of the times not just the music in the commercials but it doesn't get the respect in general and I do feel that a lot of this you know certainly my beloved R&B oldies and no one's ever heard you know I died in the people like me died forever and that's with some of this is so you're really making inroads to have this have a footprint that it otherwise wouldn't have any footprint it all and for that Grant that's the way I see it the heck what subscriptions the government should give you a grant but they're difficult to come by I know and horrible to write for so in the meantime if we all send ten bucks we can keep a lot I know if you're not a couple of them with a couple of you guys would send five hundred bucks and I could buy our grant writer you're right. I'm in Sacramento the head of the ends of the giant snake and not cheap either. She actually work for a living I know that's hard for it on a percentage basis but but still you're right you've got to be solvent in the in the meantime to go that route but it sure would be nice because I can't imagine you know we're preserving Now history of things but never happen for god sakes you know where rewriting history right and left so to preserve a cultural history and something you know which even going back to the 5th is When the Ku Klux Klan was you know claiming that we weren't supposed to play these Savage records be preserved not only that but we need to be reminded of a great song by Ruby and the romantics much better off than I've ever been before which was heard on the robin Walker wjbk Detroit March 1964 check that with the song I was trying to pick up the other night you know it much better off than I did before that that's good and you know like you mentioned the royalettes and I looked and I've got seven of them so I only had one hit and you know I got the I got the one off of iTunes and it makes me cry for the end of that song play Big Tiffany G or GM as I Was a Teddy Randazzo records and jeans dance show and polymer course that's the movie Hairspray was now the guy hairspray was based on but there are a number of great Royal it records you know it's a big mistake better not to know there's many but none of them have ever charted of course but you'll find them on various are chicks you are you go how are you what's up oh I'm good I just have a suggestion and I hope it doesn't come to this but you can have all your stuff in archives for free and they do that kind of stuff that's why I put my stuff and let's hope it doesn't come to that but there's no fee and there's no story plus it doesn't mind if you have to go to real radio.com and take a look around it. It doesn't wind up in that kind of a presentation what happens if I have to give you their money and I think it's you guys can stay there if I say what I don't know Riley was looking on Friday usually around them together and they were around 90 you know what I mean like I guess I was just wanted to say you free I'm just saying if it came to that but I don't think that I don't think the money involved is storage for one thing so you still have to pay the music rights don't you you have a girl can sorts of Licensing consideration today they would probably not be willing to take on so those are stats still aren't or larger costs haven't even Fallen Fallen doing it and they just keep giving us more storage space all the time anymore they just a works for expanding our machines and and now you've got this much more self storage and bandwidth we have servers in San Francisco and New York and servers and and bandwidth they're not really our problem we get those quite reasonably we ran our own machines for years but it was the best way to do it and for the first ten years we actually bought machines and they put him down in the Bay Area and had to drive down there every time they broke and I'm really quite a quite an adventure but now we just leased them because they can put the so many they can put multiple Amazon one good machine these are all limits machines and so $400 a year are our storage at sample that's not the problem the problem is the maintenance cost cuz you're talkin about another you know 30 hours of work each week to continue to update the site and that is not it wasn't a problem you know two years ago but it is now because we lost so many subscribers I understand I don't care about the money that they keep great grant writers is they are hooked into the sources to know what they're supposed to say to get the money it's not so much can you write it it's do you have the magic words and that's why they usually get a hunk of the grand It's Not Unusual to see somebody get 25% of the Grant and 1.2 million bucks that's a good chunk of change but it's because they knew the magic words that delivered the grant okay so it's like any other industry you go looking you go looking for grant writers to have experience in a particular area that you want to Target when you're talkin about preserving broadcast recording there's a number of organizations and groups that are already involved in preserving broadcast recording I mean for some of them what we have would be a beautiful thing because I have an excuse for him until you look for grant writers could have experienced connecting with those kind of yeah it's it really is no the secret word like the Groucho Marx show well I can put on a couple forms online in a couple other things to see if we can't get some more money going in just want to continue to survive that's it we just want to be able to do what we're doing and and and pay for the cost of doing it you don't many of us would like to hear you Riley if you throw up some of your stuff I'm not there's a there's a lot I want to hear I want to hear Robbie to charge 6 no no there's nothing of me I want to hear Raleigh playing those great old R&B record what I want to hear so I thank you for calling I appreciate it thank you ree l r a d i o.com and what I want to listen from you is that you don't be a stranger and anything we can do to help or anything you ever want publicized or anytime I would love to hear from you I really appreciate so much your attention to this matter I wrote you not knowing if you would really care but I noted that you had reached out to me before back in our sick days and I was very concerned at that time and I thought well well he's known is a really nice person so I thought this it would be worth seeing if you were interested and I do appreciate it very much but I'm not sure that that is always the case I got it on one Mac and I sync be on something that I actually will be processed what a concept so yes it will appear as a downloadable also be the only stream for a week so it'll play repeatedly for a week once I process it up there and then it'll be inappropriate if you know if I can get you a copy or something of course I would I assume you know I won't know until I get off the air and actually hit stop to know that I've got recording is but it looks like I've got to wish you and you're very welcome. You would even want them I never think anybody wants a show so that's very nice of you well I think it's still saying it's very very nice and I don't see why you would think that you're a big time right now I'm always I was always thrilled when George Wilson said I was the best talk show host who's ever who knows who George Wilson was so folks who didn't know I'm but he was a case in point of you have to win in the Halls before you went on the air and I always used to say that radio station sounded like the program directors looked and what I meant was that the station's embodied the spirit of whoever was in charge and I don't care what George Wilson Station you heard it was a fun radio station. yeah yeah yeah it came the airwaves and like when people be fans of things like WABC which I wasn't I was a fan of Ruth Mayer on wmca because the station and decided her and that was the Spirit of Radio that we loved and that is the time that we will not see again and we continue to try to frame it and prevent it in such a way that it might be of some value to those who come behind us but who knows it may not even be following very closely because how many books have been written about radio I know I have an entire shelf devoted to them and none of them by any means cover all of it I mean it's just you know what made it special is we were talking about before this all came out of it being worthless people will take a chance when there's nothing to lose just as when you know when FM started to develop of course people conveniently forget the Field Effect transistor in the fact that before that it drifted too much to be viable but once it was somebody could put it on the ground because after all we're just bump and paint religion you know where or good music amount of money and stuff like delivered programs made it easily affordable for the first time and you didn't have to be CVS to do it yeah but you also had the am band that was proclaimed As Dead As radio was a medium was 30 years earlier so if he was worthless again and it doesn't have to be radio that's the other thing because every time we talked about radio we're talkin about the delivery truck I want to know what's on it I don't care if it's AM FM satellite internet if it's audio and I want to hear it and I can hear it I'm going to listen I think that's a reasonable Outlook and expectation but an improbably reasonable I mean if somebody is going to do what you want yes if not you can do it yourself but I just don't know now I think they're too many delivery trucks one of the reasons that the thieves top 40 radio stations did so well back in the sixties and seventies was because there really weren't that many other choices and interesting thing about that statement is what that gave us again back to Sociology is it gave us the shared experience so if the old station in 1985 was doing a playlist they knew everybody that graduated high school in 1965 in Flint Michigan was listening to w t a c he was listening to the same night Jack and the same records and was very easy it is now of fractionalized experience so of course you don't look at it generationally in the exact same way but the hardest part of the internet and you know this so well is that the internet completely violate supply and demand there is an unlimited Supply and no one can search in Google for something that they don't know exists even people who might love your site you and I might think will everybody would know which there I would wager that there's a number of people who would send you ten bucks so I've no idea even on the internet if it's hard to believe because that was not the case 10 years ago yeah but for if you typed are cheques in the Google from when Google first started up until about two years ago you Real Radio is always the top hits and it never be things below it changed over the years but now it's the Wikipedia listing for her cuz I guess there's so many of them was number two now have you look for air check. I was going to bring that you can relive an hour of your life in Suburban Los Angeles from 1968 then they understand what you're talkin about never going to see you again but the the presence of weed commercial for the website they have all those visual images is conjured up and you listen to the actual aircheck so yeah oh no I thought they were a lot of things we can do but we don't we don't you know we just want to keep the lights on when we first 2006 it was $12 a year was the first time you've been able to get on that website for $10 so and I talked to anybody who remotely cares about radio would not be eager to do this and I guess we're going to see exactly what what people are made up as we spread the word cuz I do a lot of people were unaware that this was even in a whole situation even if you might say it or whatever you want to think about it and we're hitting it tonight saying that you want to see it exists it sounds like a Telethon but for god sakes it's $10 Pat so real radio. Why don't you look for your screaming and and I will put it on my tutor thing and do you have a Twitter thing mine either but this is a different actual opportunity to use my tweeters like we talked about as a labor of love and for the handful of people who really want to hear it I don't intend to monetize this at any time it's just something I do on Friday nights and it actually gets me out of the drudgery stop running to radio station and you're so very good at it as you're very cunning you're really are you're extremely knowledgeable on the subject with somebody who's got 40 right about popular culture radio in the twentieth century than anyone else I think I've ever talked to you I'm very very impressed and just delighted you had these opportunities just been wonderful means you're going to do it again and I'm holding you to it okay that's not a problem you let me know when thank you so much, it's the website next week but in the meantime I'm telling you this show you will adore real radio.com so my very vague things to Uncle Ricky for taking a couple hours out of his Friday night and for those of you who were listening and also those of you who emailed and yes we will know whether in fact both of those recordings at least one of them and digitize it and I'll make it a podcast and I'll make it a stream and I'll make it download and yeah I got a nasty email last week saying you didn't yes I did I just forgot to tell you all right I'll put it on the website so you can see that it is a download and until next week live at this time all I can say is that's a wrap it's the Raleigh James show
