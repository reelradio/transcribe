He tries not to offend anyone and as a result leads a very dull life of myself I've never really believed in that I think it's safe to say that I am never going to be on Phil Donahue show again I think my very presence offends Phil Summit some sort of Charity function recently then the reception they gave me was very cool I could even say I see she don't think feel appreciates her in his and Marlo Thomas's name on the cheap trashy Showbiz report telling about their tips and spats and tell me the Knock-Knock enough Phil Donahue I think he is a nice guy he does good work too but if you're going to go out with Danny Thomas's Kid and Play Showbiz celebrity there's a price it has to be paid and being on the cheap trashy Showbiz is the price I'm not going to sacrifice somebody the TV show I'm a responsible broadcaster with a responsibility to the listening public I'm not going to kiss somebody's and I'll just to be on TV thank you for this very nice letter in the nice compliment that I'm going to do what I don't get too many nice letters and compliments like this so find the save your letter and put it in my scrapbook because I wasn't done talking yet O'Hare Airport is open kind of kind of halfway the day has come up on it was after this next song also have like a traffic conditions on the expressway this morning and road conditions around Chicago which we will pay the rest of show me the Peter Frampton players baby come back and only by the Beatles good morning at 8:25 on Jeffrey Hunter can I snooze you want to stay indoors again today continued blowing and drifting snow is forecast with a chance for a few more flurries the people in the Chicago area still couldn't drive their cars today they abandoned them and snow drifts all over the place yesterday and walk the freedom in the midwestern Blizzard yesterday where motorists who froze to death after abandoning their cars if you're out in the open country somewhere with snow and with the snow jackets are you think it's become disorientated and you please going to come with us while you are waiting for help to arrive crack your car window and run the engine only 10 to 15 minutes an hour to conserve fuel bad weather really all major highways in Illinois remain closed because they are impassable many businesses are shut down as are most colleges and universities all Chicago public schools and Catholic schools that closed most if not all Suburban schools in 26 County Metro Area have also clients cancelled classes for the day on the good side of it crews are reportedly making some progress clearing city streets but they'll work around the clock until the task of digging out is completed Justice is apparently Snowblind we just learned that all cases due to be called in Chicago courts today have been continued the fourth time in a tree by the snow storm expected to reopen for outgoing flights at 9 this morning they won't be able to handle incoming flights until early I have to do it Midway is open only for executive aircraft while the airport in Indianapolis in Cleveland that mishap 13 remained hospitalized this morning a strike by CTA bus drivers and motor man appears more likely this morning as workers overwhelmingly rejected contract for the second time in a row the latest offering would have raised drivers base pay 2/850 an hour through threw himself in front of a third snowmobiler did capture that one wins have cleared away the powder snow on some Expressway revealing ice to this morning that we were last traffic shows Irving Park and Mannheim still blocked by two dozen stalled cars and trucks
