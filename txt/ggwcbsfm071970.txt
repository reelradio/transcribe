do a kind of a parlay thing for you like remember when the Beatles did back in the USA I'm in the back of the Back in the USSR right off the White Album Back in the USSR will they have that record came from an old Chuck Berry 1958 called back in the USAthat's what you look very did in 1958 and then this is what the Beatles did on their double White Albumdo you see the Beatles more lace covered that Chuck Berry to and from 1958 and one of the latest hits the Beatles had which I would bet my bottom dollar that nobody knows that it wasn't really written by The Beatles the words are different on the tune but this tune you'll recognize and then we'll go into something else but I want to play this for a fact so stay tuned as alright so we get through with what I'm doingI meanPaul McCartney singing lead don't want you to hear something everybody thinks that was the Beatles original to write will back in 1948 a record was done by the original Roberta Martin singers and was recorded by Apollo that listen to thisall boys lieokay what do you think about that how can there be any doubt that all the McCartney of The Beatles got that from this recording was made in 1948 on Apollo by the original Roberta Martin singers and it was coming out in which was just called that Delores Barrett is that during the high for soprano and I think they don't believe this far out so we covered of course Back in the USSR by The Beatles which they obviously cop from Chuck Berry and it stays within the last several months, which everyone gave the Beatles credit for it again when they didn't really write it themselves only the words were change the music to Styles remain to protect the innocent at all so far out hang out.
