We can talk I heard this song abouthand of the God as well as the song I'm going to play for you now about 2 months ago when that happens I know because I'm starting to think when I first came out to Los Angeles and everything but a lot of people know they will grow friends with Zeppelin In The Air looking looking anyway so it's our story by lanco.and he said that one of the things about this is David Bowie this is John Lennon song and David actually went to do this song and she said so if you guys got Tender Years and performed by one of the greats for the first time anywhere in the world right now in the worldthe game if you're going to get it done today LOL has Brandi new register 10 machine at David Bowie's new van and working that's why we all right working glad your husband is exactly right and we've been on the telephone one of my favorite disc jockeys that's not on this but then I sweetheart but it really puts the whole wide world we might arise a man I ended you to rise again and yeah we will like we still certainly will and like I said okay how you been lately I'm really glad to hear from you in fact the last time I was with the one I wanted the people with van and it was a party for Keith Richards and so we were the Keith Richards party and I know I other so-called rock and roll radio stations were present and they seem to be intimidated but I wasn't going through with the end of it I was endorsed I can't I'm glad you guys are miss you big time I miss you big time with you and I talked about how much we like oh my God I know what you're going to do you know what I'm going to do so so dusty said to me man face boy named Phoenix landfill Dusty Street and it's in the album should the world failed to follow V 11.9 we're going off you better make sure you check out the street of Freddy and everybody on the rock it's Peter Murphy the light pours out of me when this man's next album comes out of the hope to God will be out back on the air and as we told him any less than that we had at the time to go see him at the John Anson Ford Theater and they did and they were mesmerized he is a mesmerising performer former leader of our house if you're not familiar with him and many of our listeners are not then if you're not familiar with him like I said that if the film The Hunger with David Bowie stars in with Catherine didn't like her head to the side when I say that about house performs and it's just mesmerizing that's when I knew I liked this guy and I when I got the car with you and I spoke with Dusty about it and she said listen to this song and I just checked chicks now this is the one of the wonderful things about having a great staff as they constantly turning you on to great music and this is a local band and I didn't want you two supposed to be in the studio John thanks a lot I love this logic anyway anyway here's what we going to play and I want you to tell the audience about this van cuz you turned me out of this song OK part look story these guys are working in the Mailroom at an em all right and they got themselves Pretty in Pink the lead singer was going out with Molly Ringwald sister okay in the songs in the movie but they didn't get on the soundtrack to Pretty in Pink which was a willing seller and you know what gold Platinum what are with rice and finally there on Epic Records it's the rave-ups right and this is a song from their independence relay switch recital Town & Country and so John called me and said listen to this song and I wouldn't think that baby and I think you'll feel the same way remember the rave-ups the local so when you look in the calendar section of the paper you see them playing this is what you'll get you got about a half an hour left on the edge good man RJ and I positively lost me the name of the band is the rave-ups LA Zone and so like I said if you see them in the calendar section playing at wherever they will go and see them and you going to have a hell of a good time and that's when the album Town & Country and we got another this is a great night we got my man Brian Setzer on the phone a couple of weeks and you guys I don't know what the hell's going on I know I know and all bummed by a but we're really confused by all the listeners response to it and and seriously this this was quite a few feelings I got to talk to her next week but no I don't have to talk to some people some serious talk about possibly coming back up again so we'll see what happens to people that mean everything that they've been in your hood on a different number one song in front of somebody behind his record of what we had we had a great week anyway we just had to call you to see how late it is but I know the city so you'll probably thought route to the China Club about not right and you are a backstage of Robert Plant's but the time I saw you before was about 2:30 in the morning the flea medicine certainly appreciate your calling and I will see if we can be back up by the time you get home and good luck on the record and good luck on the door and get my love the slim jim in to lie I really appreciate it into your lovely lady as well and I have to be I want to play bring it back again cuz it's very appropriate what we would like to see it again thanks so much Brian Setzer Brian Setzer on the edge and I bet you've never heard this original that is the original of a hound dog at for those of you who did not know the Elvis Presley did not do that originally he heard that particular song and covered it real well and thought that was in the days when they didn't play black music on the radio except for like in Black sections and but the Elvis I ask you if you know anything about him was it very much into that is a very young man down in Tupelo Mississippi and the pain will Amaze don't know who is better known as Big Mama Thornton and you may remember her when Janis Joplin made her rather famous to the masses by covering ball and chain so at that's big mama Thornton great growl invoice you had had the chance to meet her once and she didn't want to know Big Mama and Brian Setzer who's are very nice to call and his band The Stray Cats bring it back again with your we will try to do believe me because of your support and so many people who have called and written and I'm got some very serious how far is it to get your station back on the air so we'll be a thank you for about a year-and-a-half and I thought I'd lay back next weekend last night he sat me down and said we gotta move quick if we don't have to do the music tomorrow usually I do it on Saturdays. Have to do the music we got all the new music in today then and then come in and Cynthia is here gives us A Cut Above each and every weekend I'm so glad to see you and I'm glad you came down I mean you you poured yourself into this radio station every ounce of your being is is in the station and you inspired all of us but you don't giving us such loving support and Good Night Live what you do Cynthia though it said is he go out and you get real pros and that real pros and like I said earlier who a musicologist to know what they're doing and then you would just give them free reign to do is not like your cookies it's not like you know you know what you're doing and you prove that to you made me look good every Sunday and I said the classes on the air is cool we just I don't know we just love you and I love you for being like I said such an inspiration which is real deep Campbell address of Campbell to the great thing he said follow your bliss you know follow the path with heart and I think that's what all of us have been trying to do at the station and you've been our leader and that's what we've done and we just love the music and put our heart and soul into it and so anyway it don't take that as an inspiration to whether or not we turn up on the radio ever again somehow I thought I think we will I think that the important thing is I think the messages just keep your heart make sure it's always amazed me about everybody in the staff they are staffed as well as this support group because people don't realize it's very much like television show TV Goodman can readily tell you in a boy if you want to look good you better since you have a good director in a good cameraman and and good sound people who have the same thing here the people in the traffic department in the sales department and Lord knows all the people who worked so very hard to just try to keep us on the air and go I mean that it's all get into a wrap on that and about what we going to play this song it's I think she's going to play it makes me feel better yeah Jimmy Cliff on 101.9 The Edge Cynthia was right that she was absolutely right it's about ready to shut it down so it is a lot of people to think and for those in your view in the listening audience please put up with this is just it's been off a lot of people to help put a radio station on the air and although we disagree wholeheartedly with the ultimate decision here's to mr. Bill award for allowing has to take the edge off with dignity you should understand that very rarely does that ever happen usually management to avoid embarrassment to our and a sophomoric behavior on the air will just pull the plug and so the people that you've grown to love and care for never get a chance to say goodbye to you and this man I'll do like I said we disagree with his decision that I lost a lot of class and a lot of faith in our professionalism to let us take it out there so we sure appreciate it and for the people in the building and is a Great Western in the Golden West broadcasters on Fells of course he is giving me an awful lot of advice and support and Lindsay coming is to share out wonderful share our receptionist and to enter Fran and to read and Sabrina and Kim and Tracy and and all of those in in traffic we keep everything rolling until Lily and saqib who was an intern with us for 9 months man I mean in a Honda in there without pay and got us going and special thanks to Bob kuhns and Lynn rake and Charles Wagner Alan and Cecilia Wagers and then I'm in sales Who real hard and we were sold out this last month I mean it's just amazing to Dan Roth and Danny Hershey and Steve Blodgett on Robert Road when he's no longer with us but it was brilliant and added so much to the station and enter Patricia he's been here about what about 3/4 by 3 months and I've never seen the same outfit looks like the Brian Bernard and to Rick's Gary of course into Stephen storm who produces a feast of friends and they always Dependable Scott Holton I got a couple of punches I want to mention only because of the fact that they were with us from the very beginning and always believe this innocent of course when the tide in the Honda thank God for them cuz they took off a lot of bills it is well and also dug Frank from penguins and then also and dangerous Dion and irrepressible I need a fajita good-looking Mark Goodman of course this is Jack Snyder John Schneider who could come in and just do it so well of course it is a pro Holland Winslow pipes Wednesday Hollingsworth has the best pipes in just one day we'll actually gun down the Buddha enter my consummate midday Pro Randy Thomas reach everybody everybody should know the book ready Thomas did better than any of us the best she's a pro and truly probably the most passionate as eloquent DJ ever on the airwaves the great pontificator himself of course mr. Jim laabs and say and to whom is Denise Maynard and Mr henchy yeah I've been wearing about three hats here for about a year-and-a-half and it's very hard to do most radio stations have a radio they have about a programmer they have a music director and of course and it just checking everything they had three separate jobs in I certainly couldn't have even gotten through what we did without Denise and and also the support of Miss Sue hand she who was is the sales manager who's just been wonderful in support of the station it with her whole heart words cannot express my gratitude and but most important to all of you in the listener's the most probably intelligent I swear to God in my whole heart and as long as I've been in radio I have never ever seen such an intelligent and caring listings in my whole life and I'm sure all of us has really been one hell of an experience and we hope we've been experienced it again and it kind of excuse me if I might have been but I do offer a smile for the promise of what may be still to come to the closing of this particular age which is a line out of a song that we going to play for your right now this is brand-new from the call cuz what it what else could we do I mean we've broken Wonder music in this town Christ and I think any radio station is done in about 20 years so it's only appropriate that we go out with something that is never ever been heard on any other radio station before you got it here it's the call and it's one of our bands and hope to God other radio stations will have the guts to play them cuz they have Essence and depth like you do and hopefully we will and we will again last time I'll say this this is 101.9 kedge Glendale Los Angeles via to thank you cousin I've been so emotional I got about fault at 101.9 on your fm dial now leaves the air from Athens this is k e d g Glendale Los Angeles
