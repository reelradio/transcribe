That my generation and all generations that have now come after my generation we don't have any roots are roots on the radio that's in a mean we're not actually attached to the musical culture go back one generation before they come from Kentucky their father was a country singer they learned their music from from a tradition even Elvis Presley was that he heard that that music but our generation we heard it on the radio and you know as a kid growing up in Queens going up in Forest Hills I mean that I would just like the dial all the time listen to different music on the radio I mean of course my favorite was rock and roll Alan freed but I also listen to gospel music I was coming from churches in Brooklyn or Harlem and that there was there was even a country station out in the New Jersey that's so I heard a lot of different music when I was a kid and I think that concept stayed with me that anything that I heard on the radio was taught music and El Condor Pasa with that was probably the first time that was the first time that I left really left our cultural and went to you know investigate music from when this happened to be pruned I think I remember video with my mind on you I just closed whatever man do you love me I'll see you tomorrow anyway it looks better babies Slacker Radio Yacht Rock Radio radio that is Alf Stewart and you're on my mind like a song on the radio and you know who you are Paul Simon before that with late in the evening this is 90.7 FM in wfuv.org members supported wfuv New York public radio from Fordham University
