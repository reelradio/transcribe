time I saw you write a please off my back I really sorry to say that I'm amazed Elizabeth is it it is a beer is it the what was it that got shot in his Mansion WABE news are you high in the regular stuff you might have planted a long way since the days when you were in charge this guy could be anywhere we don't know what's in there but I don't hear any engine note nothing I thought you had something rough for breakfast in a complete circle I'll come back to the land of my earlier failures to now make a big success out of chapter to add you hear that Stan Kaplan was here they are proud of you thinks that I'll do better than James Caan did the movie where I can hardly wait to see for myself have you done the first you already for the VIP do you get to the Alhambra soon you may not get to see me and people come to Ogle and Lil Wyte where we have all the maximum I dye my wife is a is dead in the place yet it didn't you have a wife that passed away to you lie detector test twice the first time it's been on there on the road is better than seeing and get your shovel which is 850 years old which I can't say anyway so it's it's a great night and we're going to give the thing it's not 11 bucks at the end of the year at the end of the dinner it's exciting evening how are you going to dress when you go to understand you can't you can't dress like this hole but I'm a chinos him a good time I can get my coat that I and you have stains all over the front of your pants I'm sorry I want it I got it I got the hiccups just for you when I cannot do like at the Alhambra I'll wear my sequins pillow so I can be back home again I don't know when I was here before I was very rude and said some horrible things to people and I want to apologize I'm now a more diplomatic than I've ever been in my life I think Hollywood has changed me one day you'll probably at the Hollywood to maybe the truck but eventually you will get there and you have to understand something you can't do all of this in front of big stars it's just impossible you the things the things you're doing I like in front of John Travolta those people you yet you couldn't say all these things you could you handle that sort of Life Garrett yeah give me a little singer with the blonde hair that looks like a girl and a girl I'm coming to a theater near you are you ready to relive it on how you ready I'm sorry I'm used to that in the morning answer Ervin cowboy and cowboy in the cars we drove in but I don't know how you learn I'm great how are you my name is yeah. 20 a heavy I told you you were you called her a blimp admit it did you but I'll be back hey I think for the brutal treatment you gave this woman you know that you got invited out to the show and I'll give you a couple of tickets to I see me at the Alhambra if you promise to lose some weight before you get out there oh okay well I'll see you later again I used to listen to you when you were here many moons ago and beyond for the people seen you on television and before I kick in all this do to go see my like you who is fantastic I think the plays as good as the food I'll be honest with you I would still be here just for asking this question I'm not going to give you a place to print tickets navigate to be committed is coming new seasons yes I am thank goodness we sign it and I think everything's going to be okay if we had trouble last year because I probably got on the show but we made moved it to another night they had Mark was acting like he knew it like it was a college graduate all of a sudden so they're going to write the whole thing and they going to bring us all back and try it again one more year but then that makes it exciting I I guess I think it's I think it is a note on my career that I could take a show that was stirred its first season in television and move it down into like the thirties and forties disc jockeys who can who can claim this sort of thing for the radio who everyone knows but there's never been anything really that's too that's me and I'm also a people are asking can I act as if I dare you to come to the Alhambra dinner theater and see me in Chapter 2 and if you don't like me you can play you can keep your mouth shut off a timer for millions of years and I think Greaseman can answer this bed and I can't exactly am I a man who plays the deli owner on Mork & Mindy ever watch Mork & Mindy where's the free tickets to the theater we're going to take her backstage you guys going to have sex with some of the other cast members and now you've lost all of that by not knowing who I am we're doing chapter 3 in a couple of weeks direct you and we could do that we could do something maybe we can have a woman calling you could do a love scene just to see it in case something happens to me you could step right in and women to see if the Greaseman perhaps to be my understudy at the Alhambra chapter 2 we'll just we'll do the scene where they what this thing will be here in a burning house you're burning house is not in the place and I just made it myself. So long as you can hardly get to the door now the decision is the refrigerator and say the six-pack if you said you loved one and one and she's going to be smoking Flames every place it's going to be an exciting scene and folks I don't miss it even if you can ready for this I'm really thinking like someone is almost on fire I'm trying baby I'm tired I know right but real has probably done some acting in his money to buy a sailboat and he's lucky I don't have no bullets in these gun just going out of floating out of the water come right through town at DriveTime and they looked up the full morning the Main Street bridge and the boulevard southbound 95 and solid all the way across the river to Main Street bridge is busy and both directions Mathews drive to pack me around University come in on the Hart bridge this pattern again all the expressway sisters doing real good and remember they are state approved a VA training if if he ever course he probably will they always do y'all have what they call the spin-off work for the network but go ahead I'm listening garbage truck well we could do that you know that you know I don't think she has any of those does between a six-pack and sex going to be exciting self listen to it on the radio baby was with you probably a year ago today I was a disc jockey and then about five or six days past as I was there in Hollywood on television camera and someone was just saying I guess so I keep going down end up getting fired again in Nashville things to be a swimming pool outside of ape we had to fill it up or take their clothes off and jump in that pool and swim into the lobby so come up here and looking for the other night Jack who would girl who went to the graveyard in the in the sky and those were there with a car with a good old days of a radio did he lose naked girls come over here and do anything but I have a good day tomorrow and I can continue you're not an audition any second.
