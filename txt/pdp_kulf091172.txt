Now you don't need a lawn chair please play show and tell you one more time and I want you to know what it is morning at KU well as I do the show I'm say and Dave Fowler tells what's going on now that's showing templates kind of Nutty Buddies human he's believable Jim's followed by Gary Hoffman who straightened mellow voice approach affords a very good balance to RSM at noon it's how McClain the hell I can only like him to at least text and self-styled Will Rogers type you talk about the poor and that reminds me of when we used to play football we was kids made you had to really have a foot to play with our neighborhood football team because out there in San Jacinto County we didn't have a football to begin with you can't even buy one of the stores so he was 10 can and it's kind of rough on the toes especially you know when you're playing with sandals but never could figure out why every time we come in from playing football at have tomato juice stains on white t-shirt it's because his brother poppy would never watch out the cans before throwing those long pass once upon a time is really people to like music by it went missing B & M o r g a n Entertainer p.m. Dr. Ike clever aware and I think it's got a great voice so call Dr Bruce the claim these new high heel shoes can be dangerous apparently your number like you know that you can fall twist your ankle actually break break your ankle and there's a lot of the folks here in Houston to sell shoes say that's not true there are many more positive things about the shoes are negative and then they're going to continue to send them another way to say well we're not going to get involved because it's not a medical problem into social problem and so I suggest that we have another interesting controversial rising in our society I certainly wanted will all be thinking a great deal about in the days and weeks to come to these shoes with a four-inch heels for women for men to and whether they're dangerous or not I don't know I saw a fellow wearing them the other day you know we had a pair of mine at the Galleria and I just don't think they're right for me I don't want to say that there but they they do look a little strange in there for that reason that I'm going to wait until I come up with him and wedgies no other newspaper can make that claim that right how are you I want to get fine I'm just fine the reason I wanted somebody to call to do you know would not be embarrassed to speak out it's that they were running a commercial for a movie called night. What is it can I call nurses & choo I think it's a character and I don't like it stereotype it is so far from reality it is absolutely blow your mind some of them if I was admitted to the hospital where you were. I certainly wouldn't get the kind of treatment that we get in the movies I believe me you would not I hate to blow another enemy but if you stayed awake for a republican convention Republican members who were Republicans were celebrating his lunch with a Richard Nixon cocktail or two of those and you still see everything perfectly clear Jim Shannon Johnny Gill and Jeff magnet Phil Knight's and all nights here good professional people music we have mentioned that yet music takes a lower position on the list of priorities here at KU or less traumatic stations probably most music station it could kill us if we play it wrong but it's not going to make us number one when we do it right we play well-known familiar popular contemporary music that's played according to a format set up which takes into account Pace orientation popularity all their normal essential things in terms of balance but it's regarded as only one element of KU well if we really can't rely on its only at all nowhere near that our boundries our foundation our math if you will it's there all right but there's certainly room for intelligence flexibility within Katie Willis format we're definitely a service-type radio station offering weather and traffic information that isn't dope located anywhere else in this particular Market can we do this without ever trying to be all things to all people you know it never works but oddly enough we almost accomplished that task In Spite of Ourselves oh yeah people don't like music by that's okay you willing to betray you in if you're not really makes us feel great everybody knows about kulfi people that like music it's right on the tip of my tongue swell almost everybody
