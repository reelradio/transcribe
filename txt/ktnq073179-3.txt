it's 97th and Q This is a longer version oh wow so idiosyncrasies of radio you say this wasn't a stereo version yesterday for five weeks before that we played it but now it's a stereo version they they put together a longer version for it that's Barbra Streisand main event at 11:54 and that means well normally we would say 10 Q with 55 minutes of music This Hour well with 6 minutes left and Jim Connelly is join me Jim comely as the program director at 10 Q radio by Dave hello Tim and we how are you today I'm just fine and we are going to sort of try to get the folks and idea as to what went on in the last year here tend to radio and how this all transpired last year the company that owns this radio station decided that it would be in the best interest of the company to sell the radio station to get those dollars to invest in some other properties that they had had in mind and went on the Block in August of 78 August of 78 and 03 4 weeks after that point we we learned that some folks in town were interested in buying the radio station and they were the current owners that klve 106 FM radio station that is their Forte they know how to program and serve the Spanish community in Los Angeles in which there is a huge population and and there are there is a need for a radio station of the size of 10 q22 effectively serve that. So to make a long story longer what happened was that when somebody decides to buy a radio station that's not quite like buying a house to get your loan approved and you go down and close but we have the Federal Communications Commission in Washington who licenses every radio station in the country they have to review all of the facts pertinent to the transfer to the sale and decide whether it's in the best interests of the public for the sale to be consummated providing that they can provide to the public to the listening audience for another service because that's really the main reason we're here is to serve the public not to serve entertaining as a form of serving but then along with that goes news and public service in public affairs and all the other things that you here in addition to the music like weather and and void written in the morning but anyway the FCC carefully review the situation and it's a rather lengthy period of time between the time that the sale was first announced in the time that the FCC to size okay it's okay for you guys to sell your radio station to these other folks they had a sort of as the New Perspective provide for the community they have to do extensive interview a thing of community leaders in the city to determine what the problems are of their their community and to plan and provides we have to see proof of their ability to provide programming to attitude to help solve those needs and at least talk about the problems and get them out in the open and call her and call him issues and instead of what all of this paperwork was was probably after you see it's about a year-long process and we were going off to your S10 to radio not in a turmoil but but in a situation where they didn't know exactly when someone would pull the plug on us and now finally we decided store broadcasting along with the the programming departments and the management department Jeff Williams included the manager of 10 Q radio on K hits radio we decided to the Excellence on that we have on 10-q radio because we've been successful in the light of possibly one of the most adverse situation any radio station can operate under that is knowing that you're going away we have been successful we have one we have a b r a m top 40 competition subject your qualifications and whatever survey you look at but at any rate we've been successful the sound will continue on f m k a t z fm97 we're going to call a k Hits 97 everybody that's on 10-q will be on K hits and everybody's welcome to come on over so where the moments from now we will be on the FM. all of us on and off the air here at thank you have been working hard to bring a little fun and a lot of rock and roll into your life we enjoy doing it.
