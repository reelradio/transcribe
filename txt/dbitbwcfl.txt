The Supremes from New Orleans Louisiana Sauk City Wisconsin it's called I love you Patricia this is not in the beginning I know the winning entry with Johnny Carl Robert Bynum said he thought it was very Marsden of Gerry and the Pacemakers but of course as you know if that's not correct Susie and Mike Coulson of Carlisle Pennsylvania said even if your mystery artist isn't Randy & The Rainbows after I guess we still enjoy the station on your show thank you very much does he thinks it's Robin Lou which is not true of course. Johnny cry was the winner and he's a while on the subject thought you'd enjoy that he said that the song went back so many years that he was still Dippin girl alright thank you very much. I'm from Chuck Manning Pennsylvania who says he thinks our mystery guest was Damita Jo know but I'm sorry I will do that was by Johnny Cash and the course our winter was Rodney hiding the violins in Heights Illinois that we get a lot of requests to play every time we play one of those old people start to get excited about it cuz he was such a tremendous just recently and had some big big hits for just a short time on the capital label back in the 50s of this was released in the late nineteen fifty-six Sarah and it was a flip side of a thing called Crazy Legs it's from a mild Ballad by Gene Vincent and his blue caps it's called important Camila play Stay Baylor University Housing boost hello I love you play something a little more but I think you're going to we did it once before in this morning going to have some fun with that we think will get you this week because we have something special plaque okay got a nice letter from chermak of Seward Pennsylvania Belmont theme sorry Paul you rock that the information about Richard Berry being on riot in cellblock Number 9 was very interesting however the record was recorded in early 1954 by The Robin's not The Coasters it was a Libra and stole our production on the spark label Atlantic Records probably bought the master and called it a Costa records and two members of the robins and two others did become The Coasters after Smokey Joe's Cafe I don't know why I'm even mentioning this until probably get about 50 out the letter stating the same thing but we thank you very much I'm at Funicello was on that as you remember and we had Pat Boone and Bill Haley & the Comets and I'll try to remember to bring it in I don't I don't know if we use the Annette Funicello one or not but I don't think so but that was very interesting her mother was even in on the interview she was chaperoning it Seven album worth I guess I've heard of Mike vickory I thought for sure it was very darvelle I do remember the song evidently someone else did it yes it was Johnny Carl also says thanks for being my little theater by the same artist I think we played one of these a long time ago but the reason we're playing is not so much for the artist which very few people probably remember what happened to her name is Jean chapel and she recorded for RCA Victor and some of you may remember that putting two songs on one side and two on the other and they would put one big hit artists on one side and then somebody else in the other and unfortunately Jean Chapel got put on the flip side of Love Me Tender and anyway you want me which methods that were sold its if they sold any like that but this was on the flip side of the record of the sons of all the radio stations in which Elvis did Love Me Tender in any way you want me and we hope you enjoy hearing Gene Chapel first like a male almost listen to her voice I have to be a member John the one. it's a crowded place to stay in Elvis was heartbreak and thanks to Sheldon poster engineer this morning who is filling in for vacation and she was the one that said boy that sounds a lot like anybody LOL and thanks for writing all so that's not right either I'm sorry Virginia thanks Gerry Marsden I'm sorry that's several people said Gerry Marsden for that Johnny Carl restaurant in Niles Michigan has your mystery singer is how many all I'm not too sure what it is but anyway we wanted to say hi and thanks for the program Terry and Eleanor Covington Miles Michigan thank you very much.

Gary Indiana is one that goes back to it was recorded in New Orleans Louisiana at the JMM Studios on May 12th of 1953 and it was written by Willie Turner and of course it's a recorded by the great Joe Turner hope you enjoy hearing this one from 1953 it's called crawdad hole call Dad home last time I was down there I broke my line I need to get them in a minute it sure was nice and sweet I didn't get no sleep Dollar Pawn Stone I can't get no more no I'm a butthead and what are you going to do now the river going dry what are you going to do now the real I'm going to sit on the bank and want to call Daddy.

We played long long time ago we had a request for why the young man what a big seller in the 50s with a rose and a Baby Ruth George the rose and a Baby Ruth to become a hit he wanted this song to become a hit because he figured if he had a hit with this record he would get an offer to go on the Grand Ole Opry which he has finally done so listen to George Hamilton the fourth one of his favorite all-time song inside of a rose and a Baby Ruth if you don't know friend he just sat there shaking all over like old Elvis Presley play we just like a grown up man she just looked up at me with those big beautiful my nose is a manufacturer he asked me why I drive a 56 Ford Deluxe with two carburetor souped-up engine high-compression heads in overdrive George Hamilton the fourth if you don't know but still remember he's not with the Grand Ole Opry and I didn't mention the fact that George at one time suffered I don't know what happened but both his lungs collapsed and in the operation to cut him open and pretty good clean living kid but there was something else that happened to him and he's became very very fervent it is a busy with the Grand Ole Opry in a great great guy I think you're going to enjoy it's on the flip side of a record that many of us to remember because of the grammatical error Travis & Bob they did a song called tell him no and during the song they said something about much more better if you remember that line which for everybody up this is the flip side and if I'm not mistaken, we're too young they say Israel Regal Theaters by the way.
