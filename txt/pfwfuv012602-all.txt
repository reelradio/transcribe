the golden days of radio how it differs from today's television radio was really do it yourself television instead of a big ugly glass picture tube you saw the performers in your own mind you are not

What's this song Altadena moonray come together like the element it looks better it's you and me baby what would cause Slacker Radio radio radio that is Al Stewart and you are on my mind like a song on the radio and you know who you are Paul Simon before that with late in the evening this is 90.7 FM in wfuv.org members supported wsu's a New York public radio from Fordham University Nursery back at wfuv and I would like to devote the next solid hour of this pageant to the medium in which I have spent most of my adult life as it turns out that would be FM radio and I'd also like to dedicated to some of the people who have most dramatically affected my radio life you'll know who they are soon enough I hope this all means as much to you as it does to me at 90.7 wfuv as long as hello my name is Roscoe of wnew-fm and what I'm about to read is written by Pete Hamill and it's called the war it appeared as a column in the New York Post on August 28th this year I thought you read it because it says a lot about the effects of War my feeling is that realizing the effects of War it's probably the strongest deterrent to war the confirmation of app I like to read you something before reading Pete Hamill so War as never before the essence of war is fine famine and pestilence they contribute to its outbreak they are among its weapons they become its consequences General Dwight D Eisenhower one of those late summer New York days when all the girls are beautiful and all the men of life in Dog afternoon so go they will swarm talk about the Mets men headed for the parks to play ball with children and appears you saw a longshoreman taking off their shirts to spend a few sweet all is watching the ball to slice up the rivers name A Small Wonders Roy Peterson Gerald Silverstein and Richard Dwyer celebrating Roy Peterson Gerald Silverstein and Richard Doria a dead they died in the swamps in the muck of Vietnam and their blood is on our hands we have rather given up on stopping that Roar it has become some strange and terminal disease one that seems out of human control Pacific diplomats it in Paris Richard Nixon in his age and sit in San Clemente at every week the best young people we all know I shipped out to die it is Richard Nixon's War now nobody seems to care Nixon got a lot of publicity by ordering 25,000 men home but there was little notice that I've been trade it would take 23 years for us to get out of Vietnam some nerve of moral outrage seems to have died in us the Green Berets got involved in a gangland-style murder and we read it as if it were a movie and not be active men from a democracy accompany a chicken bone weary the nerve shredded by Too Much Death in Florida refuse to move out and their action is treated as a one-day curiosity instead of one of the most damning judgment yet made about our filthy commitment already there are thirty-eight thousand young men dead open to a maimed and crippled men with steel and plastic where their bones ones were men with poisonous dreams in the dark of night men whose eyes will never see a flower in Spring men who will never play ball with their children at dusk because it takes arms and legs to do so those young men will carry the infection of Vietnam across all the Summers of their lives Roy Peterson a private first class in the army we hear no brass bands of Seattle you will never log on the corner of East 17th Street and Avenue S in Brooklyn watching the girls go by or talkin about the Met warrant officer Gerald Silverstein will not walk the Grand Concourse with his wife I already owe on a stretch of Summer saying I'm self tickled by the rub of love specialist fourth class Richard or you will never hold the son in his arms or feel Wonder I have a beer with his friends in White Plains them what is open they had the worst Buck of all to be young and brave in a bad time and yet we owe them something we owe them the promise that no more of their friends will die it should be our duty to change all this around stop this slow and filthy dance on the killing ground and that how young men live out their lives it is a measure of how much Vietnam has corrupted our sensibilities that we seem unable any more to act on such promises the other night in Brooklyn I was drinking with some young man all of whom have survived Vietnam that one could think of anything he had done there which was sweet and honorable I hated the war when they were there they hated more now you can come on a generation just so much and these young men know now that they work on that the brave politicians have never had the guts to bring this war to an end I know that if every congressman and Senator an employee of the defense department were sent to Vietnam its troops the war would be over tomorrow if Mendel Rivers had to carry an M16 up new lawn Mountain he wouldn't be so brave with his mouth we know how Wars are put together old men groom me with bitterness corruption and power stop the wars young men fight them this time we have asked them to fight on the wrong side all allies are the most debased corrupt government in Southeast Asia a collection of blackmailers thugs and totalitarian they are fighting for the Integrity of their Swiss bank accounts when the war is over they will lie on the Riviera Roy Peterson Joe Silverstein and Richard Doria will not share their champagne when my brother John was there as an Airborne Medicare earlier this year he found himself searching the bodies of North Vietnamese soldiers who have been killed somewhere near bung Saint and the pockets of one of them he found a wallet the wallet contained pictures of the Dead Man's wife and children and a magazine photograph of John F Kennedy there was no way to find out why but I would certainly have preferred to talk for a few hours with that young North Vietnamese then with Melvin Laird but of course will never happen because like 38,000 about Brave children E2 was dead where the armor of love and you close your hearts and peace this is Roscoe peace we need we need Atlanta Jesus Will Come I am essentially a nice person I've never been able to get up in the morning I've never been good at Anythink early in the morning when I was a child my mother moved across the street from the school cuz I was late every day I still ate every day I I love to stay up late at night I like to read and watch like movies and things like that I began to think about the night time and what it meant to me in a certain mysticism and I thought about sex when you don't feel like you have a cold or gets worse at night if you worried about something it becomes more anxiety-producing in the middle of the night I just want to send that and I thought there must be a lot of people in this city that needs something to relate to in the middle of the night and if I could create some kind of them battery a relationship between myself and the rest of the night people then it would be more than just music I probably felt that I was at a definite disadvantage I mean are we still smarting under under the phone calls like that that brought off the air which we went through a lot of in those days so I felt naturally like a second-class citizen not to anyone at the station or any of the guys but just from a historical standpoint as a disc jockey so I felt it I just couldn't expect to come on why this is Allison Steele the way the guys would and and expect the same roof for I felt that I had an advantage as well as a disadvantage and that was that I could do things that maybe the guys couldn't or wouldn't so I thought about the fact that I love the night that I am a night person and that if I could create that mood and people would relate to it it would be a very intimate atmosphere and so I began to Bounce It Off people you know the the guys on the other side of the hall which the way we describe am and one who shall remain remain nameless I said to him I think of this idea and know the night-bird thing came about because of The Duality the night for the nocturnal bird the owl and in 66 was a bird's so here I was the only bird among Olga guys what do you think of this idea nightbird and no no no don't you become he'll do the cleaning lady that was locked in the building and I said thanks a lot and I went on to the next guy and everybody had some idea nobody like this not a thing but it was just so strong to me I just felt it was a natural so I said well I've got to find some way of of creating it so I said down and I wrote a little piece and once I wrote the piece I realized I had to have some music now I went through that library next to and you know how big that room is must have twenty thousand albums have gone through 6000 albums to find a piece of music that I felt would create the mood I was looking for and I didn't find it and I went on vacation the 15th of December and I was at a friend's house late at night of above the Hollywood Hills and this particular person was into ethnic music and sitting there in the dark and that sound came on and I said that's it any bats it at my music and I took that record and I still have that original record never seen it before or since it is Colombian religious music pre-columbian Temple Music recorded by a lady named Elizabeth Waldo now after the end of this the part I use it changes Tempo and it wouldn't no way relate to anything I'm doing but just that much if it was enough to set the mood so I wrote the piece and then I began to look for a kind of music that I felt would be an extension of the a blued so this is what the first night sounded like scatterbrain the shadow across the movie sounds of the night or the night bird spread their wings and sores above the earth into another level of comprehension until dawn the weather today stop. 90.7 wfuv members supported public radio from Fordham University Richie Havens I'll use any excuse to play something from the mixed bag album Escape high flying bird for my friend the late Allison Steele before that we heard her tale of how the night bird was almost Hilda the cleaning lady who got locked in the village history turns on a dime doesn't it can you imagine that can you imagine what that would have been like we heard Tom Paxton before that and peace will come out of Roscoe's reading of a piece Hamill column from the New York Post in the late 60s about war and the lessons that we can learn from it right up to this very second perhaps people and it's a lion mixed bag we will continue in this vein right after these messages supporting wfuv presenting the new motion picture I am Sam starring Sean Penn and Michelle Pfeiffer now playing hi this is Dennis else has been recently I had a chance to talk with Ben Folds

once was a golden moment known as progressive rock FM radio in New York call know but it did happen it did exist those of you who lived it know it and we'll never forget it those of you who didn't live it can learn an awful lot about it from this wonderful Peace by singer-songwriter Mike agranov called The Sandman at 90.7 wfuv where the broadcast room the living tomb of cracked acoustic tiles in your left alone with your microphone in your playlist in your dials and the hands of a clock past midnight it's time to take the air once more and the graveyard shift begun the day shift to the engineers of all left hours ago they close the heavy soundproof door and set your board a glow to the first two records up settling your chair on the cap and snap the transmit switch and you're on the air there's magic in the radio and chant meant to the Aether a power board of mind and brain and yet a part of neither a power to be reckoned not in KW or Jules needs to let a single voice touch half a million Souls when you work that graveyard shift from 1 a.m. to 5 you start to doubt that anyone's out there or Alive the Halls are lifeless the phone is dead and there's nothing quite so lonely is to call with kilowatts in reply I hear silence only they usually stick the rookie jocks in a lonely graveyard slot with me I broadcast Nights by choice I like that shift a lot cuz when I get the lonely as I do from time to time I recall the Sandman and spinal show of 1969 1960 radio was awful and it's best I grew up with Cousin Brucie in the Wolfman on the rest in between the fast talk and the height and the acne lotion jingle and station breaks with sound effects. Maybe play a single but that was all there was back then and that was all we had a Nostalgia finds a way to sit the good from all the bad and so intertwined was radio with Vaughn scenes of my youth that is tinted with a Rosy Glow that overlays the truth and summer parties the beach and every High School date those midnight drive my dad's olds and studying till late they're all movies in my memory and behind them I still hear The Beach Boys in The Beatles in the Motown oh so clear to the counter point of DJ hype and ads for rheingold beer but then in 67 FM burst upon the scene where one plate only Boston bronze became a rock band dream between the Sparks commercials they play three songs in a row and album Cuts in full length version played in Stereo and gone was all the my limited brainless DJ chattering singing station break another floral fecal matter instead and charm told what they had to tell you spoke as if they thought that I might have some brains as well I got to know them all by voice text Summer and come fall and hung around the station till I came to know the wall Bill Clancy in the morning slide and Stacy Charlie West and the same man he was different and apart from all the rest of the overnights he had a special style he was older than the other has been around awhile Segway different album Cuts in the Stream of Consciousness into thinset live concert tapes he made listing fun and then we must have known my Navy always called me kid but he let me watch him work it explain the things he did and it and what's the price is locked me in the studio late at night and let me queue the tapes and Records up to my delight so I wandered back home bleary-eyed is it was getting life can I have the record spun he sat and talked the day has gone by when radio was younger so is he is lonely Kansas Farmhouse snowdrift blue and curled the radio with the Living Color window on the world he said there was magic in the radio enchantments in The Ether a power board of mind and brain and yet a part of neither a way to take you miles and years by means unknown to science but it's since become up jukebox nothing more than an appliance I can tell you got the itch kid they'd like to be a jock give it up the magic is gone there's nothing left but schlock you deal with all the crazies in the drugged-out suicide calls in the sponsors the SEC got you by the throat and programming tells you what to play and they take no denying you copy every teising crap you never think of buying the hours along the pay is squat vacations in I wouldn't Eddie's face the mic and weave magic once again well I'm sure enough he read me right I guess he could recognize a little of his own Obsession shining from my eyes and when I left for school that fall and higher education my first thought was to make a beeline for the radio station throughout my freshman year I learned the ropes and paid my dues I Engineers did commercials swept read the news by the time I was a sophomore I turned a weekly show I was on the graveyard shift but I was on the radio and I learned Paul Sandman was a name that every DJ knew the trade rags to the story you got a piece of news week too and sometimes playing album sides from my desire to stay the night win in his show in my headphones just for inspiration and so it was a New Year's Eve of 1969 School's Out they'd all gone home the station was online with day-old pizza pie and coffee by the quart they had me working triple shift from 8 p.m. to 8 playing records no one listen to while partying till late and CBS and hooked lines across the country to Times Square and at midnight we switch over to a live broadcast from the air to hear the famous Ball come down and ring in the New Year my 11:00. So did you just could not believe who the hell is listening to the radio on New Year's Eve so I cute up Tommy that would kill half an hour or so kicked off my shoes plugged in my phone's turned in the sand dance show a different something's wrong I knew right off the bat he's playing straight top 40 is voice to sounding flat there's that are between his cups is 5 full run too long inside of 15 minutes I knew something there was wrong I let him start a record dialed up his private line he answered with his callers that I replied with mine well hi a kid they tell me it's got a better way to spend your New Year's Eve and with some busted down DJ techno I'm on the air myself I got lots of time I do listen to your show cuz it's better far than mine but but tell me Sandman what's with you is everything all right seems to me as if you someone off your stride tonight everything is not all right he answered with a friend the Arbitron report came out and our ratings have gone down and and and Harry Stein and programming is determined that the way to get the ratings back on top is dictate what I play so here I sit with listed hand that says a 10:15 I should play the Righteous Brothers Soul by the cream and then a public service box and then some Moby grape well they do need a DJ to cut this crap on tape it's December 31st the year is coming to an end and with it ends a decade and an era to my friend and in 27 minutes I'll switch off to Times Square but when I returned and 70 you tune in if you care to hear how good the radio could be if it was there he broke off at that moment the cue up another platter and I said goodbye the who are almost finished for that matter but exactly twenty-seven minutes later more or less on Q I flipped the switch to hook a sand with PBS and whilst those in the New York bed fond farewell to 69 and Guy Lombardo and his orchestra played Auld Lang Syne I raised my slice of pizza and salute to the new year and once more to this and then at the end of his career when the network show is over with I went back on Mike I did some inane comment about the future in the like to the station break cue to record up and then plug my headphones in and tune the Sandman and again welcome he began the 1970 radio you've noticed in the past a certain this to this show seems Harry Styles with Herman what your music taste should be Harry Stine bfdc I've had my fill of radio this here's my final hour but the door is locked and bolted and I'm on internal power and and I suppose you'll find a way to get me out of benchley but until then you'll see how good the radio could be and then the music started as a magic came on strong and tell the sequence brought to light a hidden meaning to each song and where we got those tapes and record I'll never know old favorites I'd forgotten live recording some some show you can get everything you want at Alice's Restaurant always get flowers Dixieland on 78 Benny Goodman Walter Carlos Smith The Roommate cheese this is art you know this is something all sit here damn I'll do my part I open the equipment cart and stowed beneath the board and rummage through the junk there till I find the proper cord patch headphone out to preamp in adjust the input power and thus and then she'll gets relayed out through our antenna tower I reach out to the telephone dial wbba to Sansa there by Sharon Smith Their overnight DJ hey Sharon do you ever heard and there's a Brotherhood amongst the radio voice is of the night they stand behind the fellow shot they see he's in a fight Sharon at Alyssa but a moment I was gone to find a patch of her own to send the Sandman on and then the phone's that long I thought we're dead began to life as the calls came in from miles around from listeners midnight whence comes this wondrous music they would ask and I would smile when I pick it up on every station of the dial and through the night the signal spread from station on the station as a DJ sent the Sandman is Magic cross the nation so Sharon called me laughing at someone's put this and then on the network wire that's right the lines to New York we're still hook Nation why I flipped the switch to listening and laughed until I cried this and then must have reached the hero New York engineer who put them on the wire for the whole damn world to here it was magic in the air that night enchantments in The Ether Power Board of craft and pride and so much more than either and all across the countries that the overnight hardcore and share the same man's magic till it's 4:20 restock to say goodbye as they were breaking down the door New Year's Day.
