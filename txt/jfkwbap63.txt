Only faster than nearly every Western Country which had not been true in the 50s but also grow faster than the Soviet Union itself that's the kind of strength United States needs economically in space militarily and in the final analysis that strength depends upon the willingness of the citizens of the United States to assume the burdens of leadership I know one place where they are here and it rain in Fort Worth in Texas in the United States we're going forward thank you ladies and gentlemen I proudly present the president of the United States I know right now why everyone in Texas Fort Worth is so thin I mean I got nothing down about the nine times a week address to do every morning at the buck vice president of the Yarbrough Jim right members of the Congressional Delegation make the speaker mr.

Hicks and myself a new apart worth product the tf-x Tactical fighter experimental nobody knows what those words mean but that's what they mean experimental and will be the number one airplane in the world today in a good deal of discussion of the long and hard for a competition to win the tf-x contract a very little discussion about what this plane will do it will be the first operational aircraft ever produced that can literally spread its wings through the air it will not give us a single plane capable of carrying out missions of speed as well as distance able to fly very far in one form or very fast and another it can take off from rugged short Astra enormously increasing the Air Force's ability to participate in limited warranty the same basic plane will serve the Navy carriers saving the taxpayers at least 1 billion dollars in cars if they build separate planes for the Navy and the Air Force the government of Australia by purchasing 125 million dollars tf-x plane before they are even off the drawing board has already testified to the Merit of this plane and at the same time it confidence in the ability of Fort Worth to M schedule and all these Wade success of Our National Defense depends upon this city in the Western United States 10000 miles from Vietnam five to six thousand miles from Pearland thousands of miles from trouble spots in Latin America and Africa or the Middle East and yet Fort Worth in all these great historic events Texas as a whole and Fort Worth their particular responsibility for this National Defense effort for military procurement in this state totals nearly one and a quarter billion dollars fifth highest among all the states of the Union there are more military personnel on active duty in this state than any of the nation say one and it's not Massachusetts play one where they with a combined military civilian defense payroll of well over a billion dollars I don't recite these for any partisan parapet that the result of American determination to be second to none and as a result of the effort which this country has made in the last 3 years we are second to none in the past three years we have increased the defense budget of the United States by over 20% increase the program of acquisition for Polaris submarines from 24 to 41 increase the Minuteman missile purchase program by more than 75% double the number of strategic bombers and missiles on alert double the number of nuclear weapons available in the Strategic alert forces increase the tactical Nuclear forces deployed in Western Europe by over 60% added five combat-ready divisions the armies of the United States and five tactical fighter Wings to the airports in the United States increased our strategic airlift capability by 75% and increased our special counterinsurgency forces which are engaged now in South Vietnam by 600% I hope those you want a strong America and place it on some signs will also Place those tickets next to it this is not an easy effort required Sacrifice by the people of the United States but this is a very dangerous and uncertain world as I said earlier on three occasions in the last three United States had a direct confrontation no one can say when it will come again no one expects that our life will be easy in this decade and perhaps not in this Century like we should realize what a burden and responsibility the people of the United States born for so many years are a country which lived in isolation divided and protected by the Atlantic and the Pacific uninterested in the struggles of the world around it here in the short space of 18 years after the second world war we put ourselves by our own will and by necessity into a defensive alliances with countries all around the globe without the United States South Vietnam would collapse overnight without the United States osito Alliance would collapse overnight without the United States the central Alliance would collapse overnight without the United States that would be no NATO and gradually Europe address in the neutralism and indifference without the effort of the United States in the alliance for Progress the Communist Advance on the mainland of South America with long ago taking place so this country which desires only to be free which desires to be secure with desire to live at peace for 18 years under three different Administration has borne more than its share of the burden that stood watch for more than its number of years I don't think that we are fatigued you're tired we would like to live as we once lived but history will not permit it the Communist balance of power is still on strong the balance of power is still in the side of Freedom we are still the Keystone in the arch of freedom and I think we'll continue to do as we have done in our past and are the people of Texas will be in the lead so I'm glad to come I'm glad to come to this state which is played such a significant role in so many efforts in this century and to say that here in Fort Worth you people will be playing a major role in the maintenance of the security of the United States for the next 10 years I'm confident as I looked to the Future that our chances are security by chance for peace I better than they've been in the past and the reason is because we're stronger and with that strength is a determination to not only maintain. Also the vital interests of the United States does that great cause Texas in the United States are committed I didn't get any has been told to be on a good behavior today and will it Dallas Love Field area broadcast to bring you a special edition of the arrival of President John F Kennedy the eye is affected the Malaysian airport that's on ballast this is the heart of a real political Tempest if you'll recall that wasn't too many weeks ago that you are an Ambassador Stevens Creek during a visit here just puts a spotlight on Big D and the glare lingers predominantly Republican area is rather notorious for it disregard of protocol for dignitaries Arkansas and to enjoy attending embarrassing incidents today the tightest possible security measures are going to affect the secret service has been on the quiet prowl in Dallas for many days checking the route to travel the people who will be in close contact with the president the food he will eat the cars he rides in everything and anything involving the security of the chief executive has been checked reject and then checked again and those of us here in the radio TV impressed area of underground exhaustive security investigation I broadcast equipment has been examined and nothing is being left to chance for the president's security and safety are concerned the first president and the president and mrs.
