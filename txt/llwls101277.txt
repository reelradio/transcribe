man-eating Lion in Tanzania hasn't killed any more people lately did you get a call from one of the right to call this morning before I went on the air here's a here's the real disgusting story about chicken it was his high school football coach over in Dubuque Iowa who was trying to get his team psyched up for last weekend's game with the rivals across town somewhere I can't remember the name of the high school but there is nickname was the golden eagles saw this dippy High School football coach painted gold the beginning was an ego thing and then tossed it to his players who proceeded to throw it around and kick it to death what a bunch of jerks what kind of example is that for the kid writings that took the words right out of my mouth are little Tommy I'm glad they lost team got beat anyway so I should kick that coaching I hadn't thought they should do here's an interesting story about remember morning about meatball the German Shepherd is America's dog hero of 1970s the story about one of the other dogs it did not win they had 10 dogs that were selected as semi-finalists in what are the semi-finalists was a local dog from Highland in Highland Illinois whose name was Jefferson Davis an Irish Setter now listen to what Jefferson did this will impress you the family 16 year old daughter was swimming in the family's backyard swimming pool and she left the water to plug in the pools filter now do you know what comes next total Tommy and you know well you know boys and girls when you're in a swimming pool or in the bathtub or around the sink you're never supposed to mess with anything electric she didn't yeah cuz you know you could get electrocuted so if you're wet you don't mess with nothing that has electricity running through it anyways you was going to plug in the pools filter and she was all wet of course and electricity shot through her body and she was unable to drop the cord so Jefferson the hero Irish Setter grab the cord in his teeth and pulled it away from the girl and unplugged it and saved her life did he is surviving what a heartwarming story I know it doesn't say that here well I suppose so otherwise he would have been a semi-finalist actually I think that's a better story than the meatball I think so I think we have to protest the I think meatball probably one just because he had a cool name is a cooler name the Jefferson boys and girls that's all the animals toys for this morning to it again tomorrow at a quarter till 10 or more highly acclaimed animal stories with the young uncle are and WLS I love you good
