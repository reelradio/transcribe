I miss you big time do you want me to do for you that's what we talked about how much we like Peter Murphy my God I know what you're going to do yeah you know what I'm going to do one man's penis the 1st Street in the album should the world failed to follow V we're going off you better make sure you check out that she the Freddy and everybody on the rock Eyes Peter Murphy and the light pours out of me when this man's next album comes out of the hope that God will be out back on the air and as we told him any less than that we had at the time to go see him the John Anson Ford Theater and they did and they were mesmerized he is a mesmerizing performance former leader of our house if you're not familiar with him and many of our listeners are not then if you're not familiar with him like I said that if the film The Hunger with David Bowie stars in with Katherine didn't know right I like to head to the side when I said I didn't know about house performs and it's just mesmerizing that's when I knew I liked this guy and I when I got the car with you and I spoke with Dusty about it and she said listen to this song and it just kicks now this is one of the wonderful things about having a great staff is that constantly turning you on to great music and this is a mobile. and I'm supposed to be in the studio Bohemian is not working John thanks a lot anyway anyway here's what we going to play and I want you to tell the audience about this van cuz you turned me on to this song like the classic hard-luck story how come I'm not getting you were all right and they got themselves into the movie Pretty in Pink because the lead singer was going out with Molly Ringwald sister okay play songs in the movie but they didn't get on the soundtrack to Pretty in Pink which was a million-dollar rested and finally there on Epic Records it's the rave-ups right and this is a song from their independent relay switch is title Town and Country and so John called me and said listen to this song and what are you thinking about inviting us we played and I went yeah let's add that baby and I think you'll feel the same way remember the rave-ups their local so when you look in the calendar section of the paper you see them playing this is what you'll get I got about a half an hour left on the edge where you at she loves me not goodbye positively lost me the name of the band is the rave-ups LA Zone and so like I said if you see them in the calendar section playing at wherever they will go and see them and you going to have a hell of a good time and that's when the album Town & Country and we got another this is a great night we got like a couple of weeks and you guys I don't know what the hell's going on I know I know and all bummed by but we're really enthused by other listeners response to it and and this this was quite a few feelings I got to talk to us next week but no I don't have to talk to some people as some serious talk about possibly coming back up again so we'll see what's up people that mean everything they're all so early but I really appreciate when you came down here and what are you touring behind his record of what and we had we had a mobile phone at the door be great next week we're going to Europe for 5 weeks and then. Anyway we decide to call you probably on route to the China Club about now right Appliance but the time I saw you before was about 2:30 in the morning listen to we certainly appreciate your calling and I will see if we can be back up by the time you get home and and good luck on the record and good luck on the door and give my love to slim jim in to lie I really appreciate your lovely lady as well and bring it back again thanks so much Brian Setzer okay Brian Setzer on the edge do you need anyone I bet you've never heard this original where is London Rosary audio what is the original of a hound dog at for those of you who did not know if Elvis Presley did not do that originally heard that particular song and covered it real well and thank that was in the days when they didn't play black music on the radio except for like in Black sections and but the Elvis I ask you if you know anything about him was it very much into that is a very young man down in Tupelo Mississippi they picked up on Willie Mae Thornton who is better known as Big Mama Thornton and you may remember her when Janis Joplin made her rather famous to the masses by covering ball and chain so I like big mama Thornton Greg Rowell invoice you had had the chance to meet her once and she didn't want to know Big Mama and Brian Setzer who was a very nice to call and his band The Stray Cats bring it back again with your we will try to do believe me because of your support and so many people who have called and written and I'm done some very serious how far is it to get your station back on the air so we'll be about a year-and-a-half and I thought I'd lay back next weekend. Jim said last night he sat me down and talked for about 20 minutes and said look we got to move quick if I don't have to do the music tomorrow usually I do it on Saturday and then come in and Cynthia is here of course gives us A Cut Above each and every weekend I'm so glad to see you and I'm glad you came down I mean you you poured yourself into this radio station every ounce of your being is is in the station and you inspired all of us but you don't giving us such loving support and did you like what you do since you know it's late is he go out and you get real pros and that real pros and like I said earlier who are musicologist to know what they're doing and then you just given free reign to do is that like your cookies it's not like you know you know what you're doing and you prove that to you made me look good every Sunday and I said the class is on the air is cool we just I don't know we just love you and I love you for being like I said such an inspiration when I say do this with Campbell I just had a great thing he said follow your bliss you know follow the path with heart and I think that's what all of us have been trying to do at the station and you've been our leader and that's what we've done and we just love the music and and put our heart and soul into it and so anyway it don't take that as an inspiration to whether or not we turn it on the radio ever again somehow I thought I think we will I think that the important thing is I think the messages just keep your heart what is always amazed me about everybody in the staff as well as the support group because people don't realize it's very much like television show me to say when I was on TV now you see why one of us shouldn't is Mark Goodman can readily tell you boy if you want to look good you better have a good director in a good cameraman and good sound people who have the same thing here people in the traffic department in the sales department and Lord knows all the people who worked so very hard to try to keep us on the air and go I mean as all get into a wrap on that in about what we going to play this song that she's going to make me feel better Jimmy Cliff on 101.9 The Edge Cynthia was right. She was absolutely right all right it's about ready to shut it down folks in that it's a sad moment so it is a lot of people to think and for those in your view in the listening audience please put up with this is just too then off a lot of people that help put a radio station on the air and although we disagree wholeheartedly with the ultimate decision here's to mr. Bill Ward for allowing us to take the edge off with dignity you should understand that very rarely does that ever happen usually management to avoid embarrassment or and a sophomoric behavior on the air will just pull the plug and so did the people that you've grown to love and care for never got a chance to say goodbye to you and this man although like I said we disagree with his decision that I lost a lot of class and a lot of faith in our professionalism to let us take it out there so we sure appreciate it and for the people in the building and of the Great Western in the Golden West broadcasters company we got this. Leaving John fails of course of a year is giving me an awful lot of advice and support and Lindsay coming here to share out wonderful share and to Fran and to read and Sabrina and Kim and Tracy and and all of those in in traffic we keep everything rolling until Lily and secure in there without pay and got us going special thanks to Bob kuhns and Lynn rake and Charles Wagner Alan and Cecilia lasers and then I'm in sales who we were sold out this last month I mean it's just amazing to Dan Roth and Danny Hershey and Steve Blodgett on Robert Road when he's no longer with us but it was brilliant and added so much to the station and enter Patricia activity has been here about what about 3/4 by 3 months and I've never seen the same outfit as I can to make it to Brian Bernard and to Rick scary of course into Stephen storm who produces a feast of friends and always dependable got a couple of sponsors I want to mention only because of the fact that they were with us from the very beginning and always believe this innocent now Quest 11 that's Hardin Honda thank God for them cuz they can they took it out and I have a lot of bills and is well and also Doug Frank from Penguins who is running and dangerous Dion and everything repressible I need a fajita good-looking Mark Goodwin of course did Jack Snyder John Schneider who could come in and just do it so well as a pro Holland Winslow Winslow Providence Place has the best pipes in broadcasting in the pipes one day we'll actually going down the road enter my concert at midday Pro Randy Thomas has everybody everybody should know that this last ratings book Randy Thomas did better than any and any of us is this the best she's a pro and truly probably the most passion as eloquent DJ ever on the airwaves the great pontificator himself of course mr. Jim laabs and to Miss Denise mated and Miss Sue hand she don't realize that I've been wearing about three hats here for about a year-and-a-half and it's very hard to do most radio stations have a radio they have about a programmer they have a music director and of course and it just checking everything they had three separate jobs and I certainly couldn't have even gotten through what we did without Denise and and also the support of Miss Sue hand she who was is the sales manager who's just been wonderful in support of the station it with her whole heart words cannot express my gratitude but most important to all of you to listen is the most probably intelligent I swear to God in my whole heart and as long as I've been in radio I have never ever seen such an intelligent and caring listings in my home and I'm sure for sure all of us has really been one hell of an experience and we hope we can have experience it again and it's kind of excuse me for what might have been but I do offer a smile for the promise of what may be still to come cuz you is to the closing of this particular age which is a line out of a song that we going to play for you right now this is brand-new from the call cuz what it what else could we do when we we've broken Wonder music in this town Christ and I think any radio station is done in about 20 years so it's only appropriate that we go out with something that is never ever been heard on any other radio station before you got it here it's the call and it's one of our bands and hope they got other radio stations will have the guts to play them cuz they have Essence and depth like you do and hopefully we will and we will again last time I'll say this this is 101.9 kazg Glendale Los Angeles thank you cuz I've been so emotional that 101.9 on your fm dial now leaves the air from Athens this is k e d g Glendale Los Angeles
