play history of rap game number to Spector describe your Tom Wolfe is America's first Teenage Mutant are was actually out of his team's when he earned his first million but not far out at the age of 17 he wrote to know him is to love him later he founded his own record company began producing hits such as Uptown Be My Baby snippety do dah and You've Lost That Loving Feeling his production methods are the most admired and imitated then the pop record industry History of Rock and Roll gathered comments about Phil Spector from Ike Turner of Ike and Tina Turner who met Phil during the recording sessions for River Deep Mountain High every available the musician in Los Angeles what do you use them I don't use them on the station and you have like five piano players and you would have likedfootball drummers 12 guitars maybe I don't know how many home one cuz I already had 25 or 30 voices on the background that record you'd be surprised at what's really on the record every time you listen to hear something different then you don't eat put it all together man you got a genius really you know who calls now here go to the buyer they have great kids who wrote and produced and wanted to be in New York and then he went out on his own and hell of a lot of talents in the lot of ideas I thought he was extremely talented little bit strange producer has two of the best years in the record business so the khj history of rock and roll invited him to listen to records a blindfold test since he didn't know what records were being played before he heard them the session began with the Four Tops Reach Out that's the sound I love that sounds like somebody beating on a chair without it with a leather top this is the first time singing Bob Dylan if you listen really carefully and that's really what it is it's black Dylan if you listen to this record carefully you notice that Motown has the same thing Volkswagen has that has style and it's never really going out of style for a long time and as long as it continues to sell they'll go in and the old joke about Motown is you know of a Motown record is the same record recorded with different lyrics every 3 weeks you know but realistically they are very creative and this was this was really a hell of a wreck it and it's it's a drum bass sound that is very consistent there for you can build around it GTA V Levi has a lot of the ingredients that Benny had at that time you had a way to sell a song and interpret the song which is a hokie really to what Soul music is interpretation he could be a hit singer anyway yeah but there are a lot of his things around are making give it to him cuz I know directions like they are a great lot of great writers around or I'm making it without Direction so I think he could be a singer anyway but I think they are they giving him the direction we need to really found some anyways a lot like Marvin Gaye but it's not it's not important because the material and direction is much better send that he would have if he better stay on his own the Phil Spector blindfold test on the khj history of rock and roll continues with the teddy bears to know him is to love him which Spector wrote in 1957 this is a funny record This Record was cut with just guitar and there's no base on the record and I think I died million over job and I played the drum and then I couldn't make it on the drum because it was too hard to play all the instruments at the same time so sandy Nelson before he was sandy play the drum song the whole Toy Story but this is the on my father's grave is it snowing at 11 was the thing that my mother had written there and it always intrigued me and that was the story of the song Phil Spector discusses the origins of Zippity Doo Dah for the khj rockumentary all the clicking in this record was take the idea was taken from the Harlem Globetrotters their record of Sweet Georgia Brown that they play their thing, it's about you know ham bones that is bad this is getting LA to and Darlene Love you use on a lot of record she singing in the background this is the old blossoms Anita James and Darlene Love and that's really strange playing a guitar solo but he wanted a place for the damn loud though we had to turn his mic off I think maybe even heard the album Maybe in the Rhythm Section or Sonny Bono was the initial D note a on horn it's the old guy Academy Award winner by Ray Ray Gilbert hell of a day Rider Walt Disney movie Song of the South Elgin I just got a big really I did too it seemed like so incongruous did he do that this way that I

Dane record company went out of business does the hell everyone the Great lead singers of all time and this was a contribution great contribution is Reagan Skyliners Pittsburgh PA is Becky just was a

Beaumont that was his name clarinet how about The Sopranos you proved to me that it could be done that was enough black and white and vice versa the history of rock and roll with special thanks to downbeat magazine for the inspiration moves from the world's first rock blindfold test with Phil Spector to another Spector hit from 60 to he's a rebel by the crystals that sounds looking age did
