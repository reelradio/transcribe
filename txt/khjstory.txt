and number one 5 and a Half Men gratifying and I would like to say thank you to a lot of people but it's impossible with that in mind I will say thank you more the bill Drake The Big Kahuna on the Hall of Fame do Dam pictures of rock and roll story of the first book of a musical Revolution when will the time get away with breaking the format for lunch those of you who know what hours you have to realize you never heard me. 100 tall let us do our thing as long as right thing with the longer than 6 seconds and since 1965 is the tallest guy radio the only program Drake format what is gentleman the history of Kincaid's J starring Bill Draper Bluebell Drake welcome back to k-earth 101 pill plus I think there's a lot to get a perspective from your point of view on sort of the Drake approach which became For Better or Worse the the sort of the defining approach of top 40 radio middle of the 60s because the Drake approach or something we aspired to and then two others it was something they thought well it's too restrictive or it's too it's exchange rate let me take you back to be at the beginning to your early career that you came out of the state of Georgia correct Donalsonville Georgia 20 miles away and then I want the college play basketball and hurt my knee or to the radio station Eric and play basketball anymore so I wonder where you go. Are you saying you might have had a career basketball if not for the knee injury occurs at McCall's what was the station in Atlanta wake w a k a ring but we have some chairs like 42 in the afternoon drive and stuff like that but they kept moving to survey out and I couldn't hear it anymore I do I see Fresno San Diego I'm in the middle of Los Angeles did your approach start to develop wakeen in Atlanta was that what you started develop sort of your your philosophy and theories about the programming and back in Bainbridge I thought that it was pretty ridiculous because everybody was running so many commercials like I remember once right before Christmas doing it at our was not playing one one record right and one reason why I was at the commercials for 2 minutes it was supposed to be a minute I thought it'd be nice if somebody started programming for listeners rather than just the commercials right and I thought if we could have a future commercial store at work that's even a radical idea today whether 4matic things if you did you cut back on commercials but you know and say what you got to say and say it then if you got something to do is worthwhile to do that but if you have nothing to say see you in a few words as possible did that I didn't make you fly Jamaica very popular with these DJs out there did it your way of doing things we've pretty much established by the time you got you got to California right down there so that every time you heard my tax returns Jr kind of number one or Katie feel whatever that meant music and other stations are coming to try to copy of the form that they don't talk about the jingles I put them going in the commercials with Mayhem commercials but it's it's amazing you seem so Elementary now that we've been through so many years of this but back then there were a lot of wacky things that other people are doing on on the radio there were quote personalities if they didn't have something to say every time and they learned it do it when you got it and give him a shout otherwise and keep the forward momentum going to hear the music we got something to you had to get into with these guys I mean was there a moment when you sat down with Robert W Morgan and said you know you have to realize it before I got to Los Angeles sure I mean in San Diego and I kind of had more audience and other radio stations of Fresno combined so there was a time when you had you were up and down there to the state of California with number one rated you could go from one bill Drake station to another good news Stockton Fresno San Diego I'll look Angeles San Francisco and then we bought a station in Sacramento so we were pretty well all the California when you got the call to come in to Los Angeles did you have any trouble station in my coming into this this town either one of those stations in Fresno at that time more better than KFWB or Carol I frankly I'm done writing not being to meeting about that what they were over commercials to disc jockeys were running off at the mouth everybody thought the worst are just had to witness to it a lot of records that just hit that they could do no wrong and they were wrong you notes and stuff and then put it into operation but every time we find something so I could be improved we would just incorporate it right into the phone last night when you kicked off boss radio 1965 it was am and FM and sometime at some point in the sixties you told your National program director Bill Watson that someday we're going to have to put the boys on the FM side because music is so much better in stereo that is on am an oral of the analogy you drew was the color TV versus black and white photos no. What was going to happen it was just the sound of so much better in the news it was obviously better on FM and I remember everyone telling the guys I was telling the time of the old cameras aboard a General Tire on the air like yeah yeah you know did they do an element of surprise that you want to maintain with Carol and KFWB at that time we were doing the rehearsals 3 hours on the are all the cattle creative hits and there was no personality no jingle to nothing it was with that was this is and no particular Temple or anything else but pretty solid music and at the same time then they would get off take an hour off and then we go in the production room and they would rehearse for 2 hours the boss radio format and we did that for a couple of months Ron Jacobs was trying to keep it as quiet as I could but there was too many guys in and out you know so Jacobs thinks he knows who did it never works you are right and they went on with the thing of a boss radio 2020 news and all of the stuff so you took all your stuff I went on the show on television but they were calling attention to us so we invited them to try it so it sounded like they were doing what we told him to do I took it off pretty quickly you may hear changes and other Area radio stations this is no coincidence and examples about boss radio should sound then we ask you to listen listen to the overall Center examples of pre boss radio maybe recommend you dial KFWB and krla Pasadena at 11 then rejoin us as we continue our sneak preview of Boss radio at 90300 still love and care about you got to realize that everybody had to adhere to the format that right that was it and if they didn't like that then out of here don't don't come here so they know that and you look for people to believe in it and use it as a backdrop it's like an assistant to the whole thing you know that even if you have a bad day. You can only drop so far because the format than the momentum and the jingles and the music and all of this stuff will carry you even if do something mechanics of it will only let you fall so far right right I was going to ask you about that because that you know the real Don Steele especially became like the prototypical Bostock the Exemplar of the bill Drake approach the radio guy who had Showbiz and everything but could do it in 7 seconds is a lot of different combinations are yeah we were very very lucky man of steel and do you know what when you listen to all of that stuff really except for a few bits which we're all memorized still didn't talk that much it was the way he said things I got a style that he would do his sign off his breakfast Friday thing and is this and then done early other stuff but he didn't really talk all that much but when we talked he had a flair for the high-class Sunday loaded at around 50 how did Rowdy Roddy currently at 81 music station AM and FM 31 man balls that could make you feel something by suggesting it just might have tone of voice you feel like there's a whole party going on in there and you're right most of the time when you brought her that day to seeing what was the what was what was it like I wish we'd been there you all are all kinds of people but you can't really remember all of that because you're so busy one person of Jacob was telling me he had a breakdown nothing had to be carried off somebody in traffic that I guess we've been a little rough what were some of the emotions you did that that was fun and the contest giveaway stunts that kind of stuff is messed up.
