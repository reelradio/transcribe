always something for you to attend the way of rock concert but there are a few exceptions and one of those has been going on for the past 13 years at Madison Square Garden I'm talking about promoter Richard rock and roll Revival shows has over the years become synonymous with Revival concerts featuring original rock and roll performers from the fifties and early sixties and he told me he first got the idea for the show when he was in the service years ago original idea came from Mom when I was stationed in Korea with the Armed Forces radio and television service there was a disc jockey and the other disc jockeys that came from rock and roll and rhythm and blues come cuz I always had Little Richard of the Mello Kings or the moonglows are the flamingos and they thought the greater Shelly was Johnny and the hurricanes in 14 hours score of 1960 total of 25 shows at the Garden and for the last couple years he's concentrated on what he calls his doo-wop shows concerts made up with some of those great a capella singing group to the 50s one of the performers on the next show coming up this weekend at the felt forum is Johnny Maestro Johnny is there to spend a couple of generations in music as a member of the group The Crest he had a big hit with Sixteen Candles back in 1958 and 10 years later he returned as lead singer of the Brooklyn Bridge there were some lean years in between those two. Though and I asked Johnny how he managed to survive can you sing Never Stopped travel around the country to Club to club and work maybe four or five weeks at a time in one place which was unusual for us coming out of the concert tours one-nighters along with Johnny & the Brooklyn bridge between concerts on his own with the Brooklyn Bridge and appearances in Richard M Revival shows is he having as much fun as I was with Richard brings back a lot of the old feeling for us in between this and when we first started I just said we were doing just clubs in plane to maybe two or three hundred people and and here we go playing 29 + 10000 is it true home real estate the audience is really about 65% of the audience is there a nostalgic reasons because this music means an awful lot of them in their
