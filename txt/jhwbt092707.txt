radio program the beautiful day in the neighborhood good morning mr. Murphy for me please come for Christmas don't tell me let me get Santa Claus know me by juice wrld heaven and nature sing we've had some big names on if you don't mind we promo me or Newt Gingrich is going to be with us and Dan rather's going to be with us I don't think that we've ever had the amount of turmoil involved from getting this guy here and from the day I walked into town in 1990 and they do this when you come into a new market they tell you who's been here before I tell you that because I know you won't be around long enough to fall into the same Murphy in the morning is just an absolute Legend in this town and then went on to become an absolute Legend in Chicago and do you feel a little weird being a w b t that's not the word for it because I know during the Heyday of big ways and all that had even come near the studio to throw rocks at me however it is just like I take old phones 10,000 ft titanium glad to be here first and foremost and so when I get a chance to meet people like you only had the shotgun Tom Kelly and here the other night when I get a chance to meet name's been reading about the trades for 35 years I've ever and you on the phone but I only found the same thing with Jack Gayle these people remember you you know they're so I've been in the business long enough that you know after six months after you've been fired and they don't remember who you are anymore but, they remember you radio had such a profound influence back. During the time of a jack Gale and also Jay Thomas and when we did the Murphy in the morning show here having a little more of the same place again you couldn't get one person to dominate again but I have found coming back to Charlotte I haven't been here I just came to visit Maybe years ago before that it was awhile since I've been in Charlotte and some of the roads are still the same as last time I was here I got so turned around I ended up on roads I've never heard of I was just over the right one because the plant was over there and imagine how happy those people are when they find out they're signed a 12-month lease is coming in from the west and the who's this guy that she don't pull that microphone other I'm going to choose you we said we can't do the show about the Smurf in the morning show without having Larry Sprinkle here with us I mean I was I was I spent an hour-and-a-half listen to the tape of you guys today and kind I had no idea you had Talent thank you a lot of things about Larry you don't know the first five have emails about that and I mean I listen to you how much your stuff is as to where I was going to curious how much you your stuff was scripted back then and if so who wrote most of it did you write most. I have a deal I'm I did not do character voices a scripted worthy B such as mr. codgers here haseleu club and those were actually at a map where Larry Dougie's up I don't know but that's the great deal donated we did that we actually did that and got away with it because I thought I was a fortune teller this is just visiting massage parlor on Wilkinson Boulevard give you an old pic rubdown remember you still makes me driving around like he's been gone he left your 1982 and I've been at that wcnc-tv for almost 23 years and I've told Murphy this on the phone every time I talk to him there is not a month there's not a month or sometime the week that goes by that someone does not mention to me when I meet them or on an email do you have the best of Murphy in the morning where is Murphy is he coming back and it and I have the last week to email set is nothing to do this was this is before the announcement about him being on the show so that's the impact that the that he has made in this community and is it still going on station just celebrating 18687 years or something like that but it always is your name always comes up and people always say so what Smurf doing these days while we knew you went back to your way we know you did your 10 and 11 whatever it was yours in Chicago and then you kind of flood did you not go to Florida after that I did but to be honest I was in I consider I was in Chicago for over 20 years I took three off to go down to Florida to Palm Beach and I was I have to move to Palm Beach waiting for another open come up in in Chicago but I got the Palm Beach and I worked there for three years I got so homesick for a Chicago that I can go to Birmingham Alabama home town so how long did it take you to get comfortable in Chicago in Chicago was a little jealous but I tell you I really threw myself into it I had actually planned to move to Chicago since I was upset even my dad took me up there the family went up for a trip to Chicago and I looked around I had these big yellow cars you can wave your hand at stop and give you a ride and I never seen anything like that but was seven and I but I looked around and I'll come back here then you say that cuz every now and then there's two cities I can think of that I drove into that I had never been to before and for some reason other immediately felt comfortable in Austin Texas was one of them but the other one was Philadelphia and the East Coast until I was in my twenties and I thought Philadelphia would intimidate me no end and I will I drove into Philadelphia and I felt at home immediately free weird-ass it either fits or I would lie I would say that I got to Chicago and I immediately knew that I had made the right choice and it believe me it was not easy living Charlotte leaving here when they get out of course I think most people know big waves was owned by standards just Kaplan and they did had treated me so extremely well extremely well right I gave it you have seriously stand basically said to Murphy what do you want to stay here I offer it you want you want you want you want my my Rolls-Royce and every time I I really really wanted to move to Chicago though I love working there and I think I'd go in I would say Stan I really need to move to Chicago and he will reply you don't need to move to Chicago the next year I tried again and I didn't need to go to Chicago I needed a boat and I was waiting on I have never worked for that guy that leaves a part of radio does not going to come back but you know I mean he did the same thing in Jacksonville and it doesn't say I mean you did the same thing with Jimmy kilgo and I mean he just seems to have an inordinate talent for picking out talent talent they let you go with it there's nobody standing over your shoulder as long as you got the ratings and made the money then he gave you the freedom to do what you wanted to do the freedom to learn even though we all can agree up there is like one big crazy family and and Murphy was right at the center and stations and I had to deal with it but it's not like he would come in and say you don't go in this direction or do that he didn't he never censored well I got a copy of the Season desist order but you guys really did I mean for your time you really were stomping on the line you were doing stuff that anything's all species days these days it doesn't seem so at ease in fact I think some people look at what you made fun of a religious organization vfd you know what a big deal at that time that part of his part of one of Charlotte before then and NC and characters like Tammy Faye and Jim Bakker and say I had actually come up with a story on how this this started I'd come up with the idea but was just a little hesitant to put it on the air and what happened was in this was a turning point Elvis died, terrible to I won't go into how it happened but it did have them baby thank you know you're excited we have been doing the Elvis B which was started by a good friend of mine and I'm sure everybody has heard of him Rick Dees he was in Memphis at the time was a local celebrity wasn't that the imposing a factor in the music industry anymore Donuts in all of that and I thought that would be disrespectful. Maybe we later take a bath with it anyway we can have this this script ready for the past the loop Club billion dollars every day and I'm sure there's some people thought I had it in for them it was just a local organization giving one red Cent to Jim Bakker out of pimp slapped her in and inside story was on the phone to Sam Kaplan the owner of big waves within about 10 minutes and a station I can only hear stand side but screaming about how everything else is just laughing at his face and then finally he makes the proposition and this is this was almost angry here's what I heard stand say anti-christian me don't look at me I didn't like the script talk to Murphy and then he said and he's a GD Baptist which is also not as crossing a line I have a friend named apparently for the job you got but it's being forced to play pool for three and a half hours while the guy I interviewed him when someone's trying to hire you and they bring you to town they take you out to eat out to the owners housing in the entry model the studios had they added on to it and basically in the studio where Murphy his first shows were done I have to sit on a cardboard box with Mike and and Murphy on the other side that was I wasn't built on to it made elaborate open up their pocketbooks and built a state-of-the-art building out on Radio Road 216 track recording studio I made it really was to go to blame I think so let it run down and had to be bulldozed Murphy in the morning and Larry Sprinkle and I rip Patterson from of that was radio.com, your baby is here baby you don't forget about me man News Talk 1110 Murphy in the morning yes sir I will get that on for a Christmas okay you too bye bye wait what you need watch the most recent how do you spell that in the morning is on with the sprinkles in the studio as well and and the Murphy Entourage to Joyce have this Entourage when you travel around Asia by the way that was officer Chicago Police traffic reports this is Martin we were doing traffic for you guys for a while and I always felt sorry for him because we don't we don't have conversations back forth with the traffic people because we never got a chance to talk to him this morning I think he just started before we left because I know what church was doing the traffic up to a certain point and the other thing I noticed is leaving for Chicago but the big dilemma of the day that we listen to the day was that they couldn't get the Billy Graham Parkway open the inspectors were still supposed to open it at 9 that morning but it just didn't happen they couldn't get to everything I had somebody couldn't cut the ribbon or something I don't know what happened but they didn't get it done Murphy in the morning while and Larry Sprinkle in Earlville play some and pass the loot and and idealistic Hodges are you this morning Bobby this weekend I took some of the neighborhood children what happened to Bobby Ashley mystery elephant got sick do you say Pepto-Bismol did I do go to the races this weekend if you want to you can say book some blonde Beauties aren't you going to ask me if I want some especially made for bisexual bisexual has a removable bar you depending on which way you're swinging at the moment they don't know Saturday night when you bought the bicycle front I bought it from the man who owns this station are you going to stand there and tell me that the owner of this radio station is bisexual you look like a man want sexy have to buy it and that's a little bit. It is understood that money can you save big Greenback angles that was your big account they just opened the first store and a Charlotte and I did for them and they kind of a group and not just cuz I did the spots were pretty tasty to come to our local offices around the Charlotte Mecklenburg area and even if that's what they're doing these big 30-year deal does why don't they bring him out after they don't call them just stay in this town for 30 years to get those speaking people who never never called and never called never write thank you call me Murph it was great we love listen to you my ratings will now and prove I can sit here and talk about Harley-Davidsons in NASCAR all morning long because you were hired I mean was Larry all that but how did you guys get to go I don't know like the John-Boy Billy story has a production and blah blah blah and then work came to town I just kind of hung out and we are the first character play some of the Gastonia is if some of the other constantly Glee local and it is human Tammy and is Gastonia and it is so local and I got to thinking about that because there's a there's an error that that I really miss on morning radio that you guys had and and trying to recreate it got it done just walk into the community and probably is that he could have written for Johnny Carson lighter because he gets it he understands it in that way if you're a writer having been out for a while now would be as good a writer today as you were then I might take me awhile to get back up to speed again so I just was nice where do I buy make sure that when we went out of the morning that we were prepared with a good show and like I said we wrote some bits and then we used spontaneity to try to get us through the rest of the day you came from originally from Alabama explain to me the path to Charlotte North Carolina and know when you came here what was the goal what were you trying to accomplish was it to be a big name in Charlotte or was it to use Charlotte's the stepping stone or I'm just kind of curious I didn't even think of it that way I always wanted to be in Chicago and I was headed that way I got to Milwaukee and I don't know what happened there this crazy guy when they were calling me offering the you no more money and I turned it down apparently didn't want to take no for an answer going up and I broke and I said yeah well I didn't want because you know I should go to a larger market I was in Milwaukee but I didn't want to go back at that time for me because I put them in a good use here as far as writing teaming up with Larry and I think we did like a very good local radio show that's the first time you came to Charlotte I talked about this today downtown was a ghost town but when you first came here did you or you will have a little bit of trepidation about coming to this really kind of a elk that was the first time I don't care who's president but can I get a shot of whiskey please I told him to South Carolina and it wasn't that much going on we just play the Mister Rogers Band in my hand is a letter from my Mister Rogers Neighborhood asking you to look at the name of the basil Cox hello this is based out of this did you by chance I change the name to mister codgers in and went along with it did you get a cease-and-desist order about making fun of us and AccuWeather Nevada Police Department by this not near her elbow and is Ada this radio station at that time but I don't know who exactly was in charge but they would always did just take such a front and everything we did they threaten to file a lawsuit about 80 weather and I think the television station said we think our listeners can probably tell the difference between the service that we had to go what happened at the make them really angry was there was there some prediction that it might be a snowstorm and a Charlotte and I can have that can stop a city it will melt quick quote something bad, but I can't even make a job and come at 6. But of course because you got to play something up like that she was absolutely correct on her forecast because she couldn't make a fist do dartboard with darts and throw them at this section out and then that would be here for you but what I do everything I still come visit me that's why I gave her 10 years ago but one point in the show Larry and then when did the weather forecast and I'm program the other way and I'm sitting there listening to it today thinking doing the weather why didn't he let Larry know what was worried about schools trade food places to put there's something wrong with a Sprinkle child I have some family that lives here and they know that you and I were to get I only danced not really his name is really mine. I'm about half honest t-shirt here John's got right but the hancocks right and I'll let you talk to the Murph in just a second on this day in the year of 1932 for the first time the doors open to Radio City Music Hall in New York City the Rock at the Rock dance krainer came out introduce them on the on the first show and it's a shame the most of the tapes that first show in the dance instructor came out we're lost in the Radio City Music Hall archives the cake with the first dance instructor as he stepped out on the stage to introduce the young lady Wake Up Everybody by and put that around Isaac Asia voice of Bob Quincy who is no longer with us also request a great sports writer for the Observer the news for that you are successful in because the nav is in town right now as is done to the industry and its it it really has taken some of the fun out there and things are cyclical things will change but there are the last couple years I worked and I've been off here now for two years I think we're getting a little bit different and they were the deregulation is no doubt diminish the effectiveness of what radio can do these days because of it I understand the radio stations are in business to make money but I guarantee you when we worked at Big waist and made some money off of it in those days you'll remember that what you were looking for a job they would tell you know there's like two different kinds of organizations right now there's programming and figure out which one you were actually interviewing with there's no such thing as a program oriented radio station any more than all my machines recite me for this much money I'm going to cross the street and no more benefits and you'll like it by God say hello to the Murph hello by the way thank you for holding I don't know what it is about this host here but he kept you holding for like half an hour yourself and thank you for having the patience to put up with his welcome I will put on beautiful you look in a minute but anyway oh God I can't remember back when at 6:10 a.m. 45 minutes how are you listening I'm listening I'm looking at you I can see what are we going to have to say you're sitting right there I just hope it doesn't work.

The Passover Club when I felt the run his course I left and went to Chicago and right after that is when Uncle Jimmy went to jail and I saw him staging is is is nervous breakdown on television I thought oh man I wish I were here in Charlotte just for one more day to do it several years later I was working in Chicago but we were in Orlando during a radio station from Disney World at a house down there and I sent my my guy out I had a guy you know every morning show has a guy and I don't understand something when your dog you talk about that we gave it back. I forgot what kind of scam we were we were punching her with her house and knocked on the door and she came to the door and it took her about 30 seconds to figure out the who is behind this and she screamed and threatened something about lawyers but in the meantime this little tiny little dog came running out to the yard so I grabbed the dog was holding any head of a megaphone we've got your dog contact I had with him at all but I never talked to him in a residence in Chicago and I did have a place in Florida and then a hurricane named Ivan properties what is down all my place was flattened by a hurricane o kid and I lost that an automobile all at the same time which is a picture of his car was all over the world it was like perpendicular sand and end of the gulf water the garden on top of it you have a place down in and near Palm Beach where I work there at all or back there and assorted other members of my family so I've been back recently had to take to make a decision between Arc is that the magic was the older generation there and they had two guys that have done a Morning Show there for a long long time and one found religion and took off and the other one was left mornings are and then I was going to walk across the hallway tonight find a Jack Daniels 30 years or fifty thousand water that's to me that's patients logy Robert Murphy and Larry Sprinkle you just sit tight okay thank you calling for $1,000 blue bottle for birthday May 1976 but people didn't wait find out where was he just took off running. We're sorry to put that shovel away okay yes tell me what is a thing you'll need but I have never connected today between you been on the radio and being on the news we're all in one character after another so I will try to do that but I will not be working too long if I do a news directors love that you don't tell him ahead of time that's what I that's what it what is it again music to Mr Murphy Richard cell letter while Robert Murphy Larry Sprinkle Richard Allen Richard Allen the air with you photos when I'm on the way home from work and Mister sprinkle I love to see your smiley face I hope it's what he's going to say many memories from those years and I was a kid back then but that was an old song about Kings Mountain vs South Point Larry's going to handle that one. That one that one man and me together, I was here I arrived in Charlotte big waves in 1976 September 1976 at Murphy came to us and you had you had Robert Murphy and I don't know of a station that can boast those three that strong lineup in a short. Of time so when people get B mixed up it's for the time in this also we were talking about the Murphy the morning show but they're also at any number of talented people during the other day Parts Scott Slade was our program director and I did afternoon Bernie Sanders is great job and I was so important to the people of Charlotte during the we got 60 70s and early 80s are you amazed at all the impact that you that you still have on all done so many people cuz I hate surprises me I'm not that they remember you but that they remember so much about what you did in the end radio you're not you know nine months after you're gone 99% of them are supposed to forget you but I think maybe it shows how many people grew up in this area or around this area that are still here but for you to be able to come back what is it been 20 57 going to be staggering and it's staggering to me it's somebody who's come and gone from radio stations and knows that here today forgotten tomorrow it makes me proud have to get in touch with some of the formulas because I do enjoy when they remember things that I've done remember things that it takes me a while to remember I was I was home alone in my cabin and can you say Google walking was every time he was saying something that somebody else was unaware of he would say ladies and gentlemen little does mr. Murphy know that way which was something we use this all the time is going for the jelly Kreme Donuts to go ladies and gentlemen little jelly cream with Napalm exposes add directions to figure of speech which he explained that to other things I do enjoy very much and I had a great time being back here in Charlotte shooting.
