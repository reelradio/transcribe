As matter fact a 1/2 game we got wet in first place this time let's talk about the changes they made Brad has been a lot of talk about the shore I can school be going up to Vancouver AAA baseball to Big Lots but you was leaving taking batting Scooby-Doo veteran but in return the Diablos have received K more who's played almost 100 games in the big leagues has eight career home runs in the big leagues so obviously he's got some pop mix. She'll help Stan Davis who led the Texas league in RBIs three years ago is back here and he hit the game-winning home run last night Allen Cartwright two brand new outfielder who had four hits in his debut the other night up from Stockton he was supposed to make the club out of spring training when Scooby was sent here he had to go back to class a ball so he's here now and Paul Hartselle or right-handed relief pitcher has been four full years in the big leagues so he has a lot of experience and is on the comeback Trail now after a severe arm injury so I think the additions will be effective I think what Jim Paul said earlier the enthusiasm and it and just the great desire of these fellows to play here in El Paso before the great El Paso baseball fan who carry the club in the second half how to tame a lion I mean first of all our gym Paul and the rest of the Diablo organization to put together one of the one of the hottest and probably the most popular minor league baseball team here in the United States in debt and the fans are really support the Diablos and that has the has to has to get through to the players that kind of enthusiasm for four or five hundred fans and night compared to four or five thousand here so you tell me that doesn't make a difference to you bet you it has to well good luck at all by the way tonight is your night in your man Clutterbuck will be on the hill but man I can't wait to look at you know I always know because Chris music and days in advance the biggest Diablo fan in town music Michael's that even that one time you related the story to me when he was up in in Lubbock flew down to Midland to catch the Diablos playing the Cubs he sure did not say I'm looking forward to the second to a half of the season and also the playoffs I'm sure we'll be on well if we win the second half will be involved in that dog fights your right super pride and thanks for the answer thank you Brad and thanks for inviting me again into the chandelier real good loving you know you're welcome and we look forward to those reports every morning to thank you hope to the Redmond finally I mean keeping bees that's really got to be different no kidding you you keep bees you came from California been working your way up to the ladder of success and certainly I hear most recently with the ratings picture and the overall that the overall performance of Channel 7 I'll tell you what to you you're the hottest way to get the hottest TV station here in town it looks like Health has been really exciting for me and great experience.
