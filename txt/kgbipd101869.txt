they are dying to take us away the Fool on the Hill sits perfectly still and do debt and grins Deadman's foolish grin on Blue Jay way George Harrison wrapped up in eastern symbolism and religious fervour in floors Paul to resurrect himself before very long and plying the first time a realization of the essentially religious nature of the plot walrus is Greek for corpse John is crying is also obviously contemptuous of those unaware of the plot not having assumed the role of God the adoption later on also the end of walrus contains passages from King Lear about death and villains recorded simultaneously with a radio broadcast that never took place announcing Paul's death to the world serviceability the closing song of the album All You Need Is Love is the premise for letting us

up his eyes John Paul McCartney Prudence back in the old days when they were known collectively as the Nerf twins nearly every tune on the album contains obvious references to the hoax culminating in Lenin's vision and Revolution number 9 this sound collage is clearly the whole story according to a god-like Lennon beside the obvious chaos to take this brother may it serve you well to take play Backwards near the beginning has a man saying Turn Me On dead man plus we come to Abbey Road on the cover is John Lennon dressed in white and resembling other day and anthropomorphics God followed by Ringo The Undertaker followed by Paul the resurrected with a cigarette in his right hand the original was left-handed followed by George the Grave Digger and if you look closely they have just walked out to the cemetery on the left side of the street bus Paul was resurrected given a cigarette and let out of the Tomb there by conquering death With a Little Help from his friends the album itself contains Clues to his death and now Clues to his resurrection Maxwell's Silver Hammer is a tale of religious Justice with a bashed-in head for punishment Octopus's Garden is British Navy slang for the cemetery in England where Naval heroes are buried I Want You She's So Heavy is Lennon wrestling with Paul trying to pull him out of the Earth again John's apocalyptic Vision has crystallized and after a seemingly endless amount of chaos and confusion the music ends abruptly as Paul is extricated the second side and ounces the principles upon which the religion will be based Beauty humor loved realism objectivity it is a religion for every daylight it analyzes interpersonal relationships in You Never Give Me Your Money explains Paul's part in the ritual in Sun King Here Comes the Sun King everybody's laughing humorously and a realistic look at life with boy you're going to carry that weight a long time the preceding information was contributed by the Michigan Daily and Brake magazine Los Angeles over the Paul McCartney is not alive keep in mind that the riddle has not been answered the question still stands is Paul McCartney alive George Harrison the song walrus is Greek for corpse approximately 2 years later the walrus shows his tusks I'm From the Same album as a portion of Revolution number 9 number nine number nine number nine number nine days together with Prudence with this knowledge in mind find a meeting in these lyrics Dear Prudence won't you open up your eyes Dear Prudence won't you let me see you smile again but most chilling of all is Ringo Starr's country flavor of what was apparently Paul McCartney's fatal auto accident everything for the album revolver it's going to message it's been a game for like Paul his sort of gotten hung up in his hand he's there doing this all is a group together is he alive The Beatles press age we picked up his car service for him repay is gone big lips comes in and says thank you to it I'm the man frenzy frenzy Frenzy Watch Me Whip Nae Nae put on the news. what is a mantra call Devon mobile. dropping your I hope the other way beneath the surface Paul McCartney rests with eyes awake is he dead since you down father and rescue play John's favorite color black yet he walks Among Us in the son of a taller a different fall but altogether only won the series continue as the riddle unravels be in memorandum from Brian Epstein who is your manager another man has found what he believes is the whole answer with the new Beetle this represents Birds representing the next album is Magical Mystery Tour and it shows people taking trips and this represents I believe life is the next one is a white Beatle album this represents the next one is a road they're coming from a cemetery represent Stephen this is my Siri to the whole thing is represents life in general from birth to death of how close is he to the Troops are you anywhere near the meaning of the message 1 + 1 + 1 is 3 and you are me and Here Comes the Sun King the story is there we want you to say that William Campbell was used in pictures many things were set up to be misleading it's also true that many things can be written into a situation with a Little Help from your friends something stated did not balance example 28th if if Paul McCartney were alive he be 28 no he be 27 but if he'd not been resurrected this year he would have been 28 I'm still dead spiritually not physically on his next birthday is Paul McCartney dead when kgb's spoke with apple records in London's an official spokesman told us Paul is alive and well you should have said alive and together we speculate that Paul was dead only spiritually pronounced dead by the other three Beatles please one Paul McCartney we suggest that John George and Ringo were in the process of bringing fall into the living world of their intentions a new religion based on beauty humor love real and objectivity a religion for everyday people the cover of Abbey Road clearly reflects the resurrection of Paul Resurrection into compatibility with the other Beatles The Beatles have finally come together the next move is theirs or is it ours the whole situation somehow rings with a message when we look at something how much do we really know about it when we approve of something do we really comprehended is the riddle a message to help us find ourselves when we listen to the music of The Beatles did we receive the message right before our very eyes know when we speak of peace love and Brotherhood do we comprehend what we speak do we understand what we surface Lee advocate Paul lives is a time for us to come together is it time for all of us to be Resurrected take this interpretation may it serve you well as you carry that weight brother jgb gratefully acknowledges the following contributions that as a group made this study possible the Michigan Daily newspaper for their provocative comments which led us to further investigation of the subject Capitol Records for earlier music in the Beatles apple records in London for the sound of the group today Bob Hamilton editor of brake magazine for his cooperation involving exclusive material Beatles press manager Derek Taylor personal contact with the group special thanks to the two young girls who gave us deeper insight into the significance of the message as well as the many other people who listen then gave their thoughts their hopes and their health Buzz Bennett who directed our efforts the production staff for the writing and concept of the program a deserving thanks to Bobby ocean edited all of the material a separate thanks to the Beatles collectively without whose genius this message could not exist alone to John Lennon's closest to our story and most of all to Paul McCartney then maybe William Campbell sing in the nick of time
