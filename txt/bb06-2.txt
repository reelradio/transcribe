welcome back to build a Lake Lewisville Legend the kraut I don't know if our employer is going to approve of all this gambling activity make her a millionaire I guess my money goodbye have any time I hear it and Donnie Todd with Sean Sunday more like he only 7077 I have to 7 a.m. my blankie Bell really good morning hope you feeling well this morning with proceeds not actually going to charity more details I'm coming let's continue hearing from was always a favorite of mine. He works at wklo my father hated hearing it said he was too sarcastic but I thought Bailey was fantastic I was right in the summer of 71 I got a job at waky production weekends off an overnight shift it was a real thrill to meet and work with the Duke of Louisville and made known to the bar for so many years and I did overnight sometime in the morning usually only a few minutes or 40 minutes was a real kick to get to do a few minutes of the most popular Radio Show in Louisville I probably didn't help his ratings but probably a year and as long as people knew the bill was on his way in they would have waited around for him to come in sometimes I be clever and put odds out on what time the Duke might make it in and we actually had a handicap room sometime call in and help out with this is was usually okay with Bailey of course the Duke was infinitely more clever than me on the air him one morning I got my just reward for playing with fire this way on the way into work Michael Lewis Griffin and Michael Lewis Griffin is being replaced there really a powerful personality scanner a little fat Joe Bailey had some kind of special magic going with several nearby restaurants are open in the morning downtown restaurants for fall in all over themselves to send the Duke all the free food and coffee he wanted it sometimes happen that just a little hint by him on the air and read some Coons or more usually breakfast or coffee from Leo's would show up I wasn't even open in the mornings but apparently the head chef was a great fan and staff was in and getting ready for the day when extra people like myself were around in the mornings and the Duke was ready for breakfast would call over to be sure that Leo was soon enough for everyone this is a very tasty breakfast and I believe to this day that it was all due to Bill Bailey's magic nothing more and Bailey was magic if I ever had a radio Idol it was real Bailey he is a master of the air Master Communicator a master happy so I can to Keeler he served a great breakfast on a show thank you Bill Bailey from many years of magic and all the great entertainment must have read my mind my own business was just a word to mean the radio control room here's a guy who receives more requests for himself inside the ropes. Enough sitting here listen to the level of play Bailey was at made me think on the drive back to Shelbyville that morning that it would take me to Lifetime to work every possible angle inside and sometimes outside the lines with format in order to relate one-on-one with his audience River City Mall either way he had it to burn sitting three feet away while he worked I noticed how everything behind the mic seem to be so effortless or something he wants to tell you listen to one of his competitors on the way in on one of the other top stations for Zachary's and bills opinion the man should find a line of work that he would truly enjoy Luther Ingram If Loving You Is Wrong I Don't Want to Be Right where you going to be a DJ this week I don't want to be right there play why 64 degrees just about decided that is not the food but the coffee that's in my chest every morning think I'm going back to my Salt Lake City buljan Gary Glitter even listening and other than occasional hell or damn like the morning the police record do Oldsmobile Cutlass Supreme from the back of the language you use on the program is number one ratings came the old-fashioned way with talent to give a glimpse of how his popularity crossed all the demos as far as my junior high school middle-aged moms and dads and grandparents the pulse of the Dukes tasted menswear in Lemoore the traditional side which is perfectly place of employment was on the line with listen to the National local beat around the bush and he had an uncanny knack for laying his opinion on the line in such a way that whether you were the average man or woman on the street or a doctor or lawyer or Indian she immediately where he stood was so well grounded in fact logic and common sense that you knew we was right there's a line for my favorite movie is fast wife pushes himself so hard to extend a talent to its full potential and he replies someday when I walk down the street I want kids to be able to say Hey There Goes Roy Hobbs the car was and so it is with this one very special radio personality Bill Bailey Z Duke of Louisville what is a record by the Jimmy Castor Bunch that's really coming up on the popularity charts not only here in this area but all over the country troglodyte you know who buys just record and make it makes it popular the dumb one but don't know what the word means saying they want to keep it popular until I can locate it in the dictionary I just maybe they're up to the fees by now they take it one page at a time it's going to take some time and you going to have it on this program this program got a little plasma every morning finer person I've ever worked with as far as an Entertainer if you were to look that word up in the dictionary of the name Bill Paley communicate one-on-one with the common person in the common person when I say that I mean that 70% of your audience and just I think always had his thumb on the pulse of what that 70% of the market with thinking and although perhaps not all of them liked what he was saying they would all listen in to see what the heck he was going to do next very powerful I'll never forget the time that she put out the word that I was having some marital problems and I wasn't but that doesn't make any difference to Bailey and my poor wife and my poor children the problems were just getting probably needed some help and lo and behold it wasn't a matter of just a couple of 3 days before she can food arrived at the radio station and some check came in the mail anyone else would have done that I probably would have taken it personally and been mad but Bailey had just a way about him that he could pull that off with the Bill Bailey sometimes it didn't make it till the end of the day you never knew you was going to do but yeah every day was a pleasure going into work with Bill Bailey because I mean I was the student and he was the teacher I learned a little bit more everyday about the big monkey chewed Tobacco on the streetcar line jumped over the lazy dog facts 7 years old and tell him what you said read what you do for a living being played I should say benefit games it's while they Mighty acts memorial fund that's at Saint Helens field and Shively the first game will be played at 7 that's this coming week at wacky's truck Jackson talks about Bill Bailey I didn't show up for work there was a several times that I went on here at 10 and didn't get off till 6 the next morning it'll daily you know he would just come in sit down at 6 in the morning and open the microphone and it would just come out he would just take what what's going on in the community and in the world and turn it around and put a little humor into it I listen to it when I was in grade school when he did mornings at wtlo useless to him every morning thought he was just fantastic and then I got to find pleasure of working with it all but a guy freejaden Manville were hand-in-glove what a show they used to put all these day was fantastic to listen to a muddy mess of WJZ-TV in Baltimore bebalu because he mastered the art of speaking to you as you don't have a command of the language that was unparalleled it was in a way you had never heard before and he spoke to you once again not at Brent Howard Cosell had a great command of the language but used to in fresh and announced to speak at Perkins will take less you believe that he meant it because he told me you didn't announce it at only reminder might a been a TV for 30 years when I was visiting your phone radio on TV too loud to gripe don't we know all of a sudden got real serious and looked at me and you said you can hate them but you better love your audience so what do you mean you said it's simple if you do not know your audience Bratayley doing a Morning Show is I do on TV given amount of good morning radio he said if you don't love your audience they're going to know it and you're going to fail you can gripe about your employer if you can disagree with the job that you better love your body that he stopped looked at me and not it is if this a kid that's guarantee that's Elton John KY but the dude what a great wacky Scavenger Hunt is coming Randolph is wacky program director in 1977 in the program the radio station till 1979 with Bill Bailey is probably a little different than most one he's somebody I actually grew up with listening to on the radio and finally somebody who I work with is his program director Back in 77 77 when family first one on the scene in louiville Taylor been sent here from another dimension she wasn't wearing hippie jock and he didn't have a rap like the rest of us want to be Josh could copy like we could stay a while and Decker or Ally gray he wasn't young he wasn't old he wasn't Country Wasn't cute he was just real real in a way that incubated people like Stern real and that he played out his wife on the radio you knew where he bought his groceries what kind of car he drove voted for and how much sleep you got the night before you knew if there was a bug up his ass and you knew what that bug name was some of the most Soulful moments I think I have ever heard on radio we heard about his wife cramps we heard how many days until countdown what names they were toying with you name it like a soap opera this man unbutton his life and showed us what a tremendous big heart he had a man how his life was exactly like ours he was like this every man quite frankly was at a point where the management thought bill was getting a little complacent and although I've kept this a secret for a little more than 25 years I was appointed as the bug to go up and moving into this Take This Job and Shove It attitude about work and Bailey annoying me as his memo I made me a really good for a while I wasn't really comfortable doing it I have two men and it wasn't anything close to it dynamic between us between boss and employee Dynamic to quote on quote sleeping in my own bed without the benefit of clergy Bailey was was not very shy at all quite frankly about hearing my laundry out in public much to the Chagrin of my girlfriend's mother and her brother conservative with their friends one of the things that I discovered that they were both frustrated artist and I know you hadn't had a chance or taken the opportunity to let loose with some of that creativity for quite a while the first thing that came out of that that kinship was our version of Randy Newman short people at least listen to while people production was fairly Elementary we used to take out the vocals one of the same tricks I used on Barbra Neal but it gave Bella a rock They Carried into a birthday party I got him some new water cooler play on some of the George Burns consulted just want to sound like short people into tall people do bail 879 wakyoto school rules in the sky the only one they got not too long after that close encounters the movie was being released and we came up with some cockamamie idea called Close Encounters of the 79th kind to play off of Close Encounters of the Third Kind it was your typical play the tones and going to win contests but the jewel in the crown was how Bailey kick the whole thing off your own theater of the Mind come up with something that is totally awesome at a time back to McClendon's wacky debut who played Purple People Eater between those little freak outs episode must have lasted an hour or more in any PD who is driving through Louisville probably thought we lost our marbles probably add but it worked like a charm any time that we could get the cops to come down to the radio station to make sure everything was all right. here's a little bit of what it sounded like failing in Close Encounters of the guy on wacky's Close Encounters of the Third Kind weekend at 6:19 6:19 wacky time Bill Bailey and I believe we have Bill Graham standing by with a brief report for us spell I think bill has been there we are okay this morning I know I have you noticed that there are two or three automobiles in the alley that's simply stopped running a craft one of those UFO was just hovering overhead a very nearby that happens that large crowd at the River City Mall is a transmission from across the river will be by laser beams from an extraterrestrial craft weird things are happening around here now my ashtray that was standing directly in front of me mysteriously it's disappeared and all of a sudden it reappears but thank God whoever caused it to disappear and reappear had the decency to clean it for me thank you very much spook at wacky I'm a close encounters weekend of the 79th kind internment rights do a loan of 15 this is Val Bailey with more Close Encounters of the 70s guys hope you have a very strange presence in the studio this morning for some reason we know what about your thing lo15 tomorrow snow ending and cloudy height snowing in Cloudy High reading about 28 degrees tomorrow what are you expecting Sia reading today personally both pretty chill degrees this look up had several creatures in the past try to control me you'll be stuck and I divorced each and every one of them so get thee away from me evil creatures from outer space or another world where were you from it looks like it's going to be an all right date them I like it was yesterday maybe just a little bit woman it's 9:21 ladies and gentlemen in the past 10 or 15 minutes something has happened to our Duke of Louisville bill would you care to explain what your problem is I don't want to give him something to play on his my Bill Bailey Story Probably are but it wasn't impossible to work with improbable sometimes but never impossible the part most of you don't know is that he's a very real very passionate very loving person without his help we would have had the success we had and I personally have never learned the value of Personality their well-earned freedom on the radio without his guts there would not be a Howard Stern in there probably wouldn't be a Rush Limbaugh are many of the talk show host there are today Bill Bailey is an original along with cord McClendon and Johnny Randolph and Jerry Burbank trust me he is one of wacky's four horsemen 1976 transition to the new store I think was the most talented person that I ever worked with or against for that matter go Bailey was a genius. He had Gary Burbank in my book are both Geniuses the difference is in Gary will be the first person to tell you this Gary spends hours of time off the air in preparation for a show in writing and recording and planning and we're as Bailey would just walk in and any show prep you have done was strictly in his head Bailey didn't even use and I don't think you knew how to patch the phone through the board so since we didn't have anybody to play off of you would either playoff the news person or he would talk to himself which kind of got to be a characteristic of a Showboat inform it was almost like listening to Mark Twain live start telling a story and it would be seamless there were no pause the patient's it was a fully conceived work of art from beginning to end and yet so far as I know it was almost entirely extra brain is he was a tremendously funny guy and he was a great guy to work with you part of my job just drive to me by the president of multimedia Corporation was to go out with Bill whenever bill went on a bender in to make sure that the art and was settled Mentor in any fights and that he got home safely so I was the only guy that I know of his job description included getting drunk but Bill was always a very generous thoughtful guy and I have to say sometimes when I listen to old are checks at my work with him I still cringe at some of the things I said and wonder why he didn't just slap me upside the head cuz I probably deserved it but was very protective and very considerate with people that he worked with in and was fine gentleman a talented artist to buy the Wave A lot of people don't realize if you seen is happen we'd like to know about it be sure to call w a k y 59 News Kentucky and weather partly cloudy with a chance of showers today tonight and tomorrow at 6 to 7:32 what's the guy's name again Danielle Owens yeah, he's married to Roy Rogers right you're thinking of Dale Evans I don't I don't know if they was married or not cuz I'm already to his job to be going to help him out he was married to his job you talk about dedication man he is one of the kids are allowed in the clubhouse I thought I'd take a baby Jupiter up there with me some evening and let her pick up was it too for me so I could be wrong but I don't think they are they don't think they all read I do recall ever seeing any children in their Quest have seen some guys lose their money that I acted like children in a matter of fact I think I could have been accused of that a couple of times that I'm stomping my feet and using Voice language just doesn't go over in a very select route such as we have up there right here eating all that but next time around is going to have to be a class race man they named a race after you once before no oh yeah couple of times but from now on it's going to have to be the Bill Bailey handicap is going to have to be in a lot more drunk right isn't that the build yourself I spend every waking moment behind this microphone trying to develop your reputation and you spend every moment kind of illness all the way back to your childhood so your mother and your father put you in the rowboat they got in the Rose Bowl beside you they put you in tow they took you out to the middle of a new set you adrift out there since that time you've gotten the impression that nobody wants you nobody loves you yeah but a princess discovered me among the reeds when you start thinking things like this nobody wants me nobody loves me just remember this you're probably right you among the Reeds thing to say some Egyptian princesses I recall an Egyptian princess atop an empty milk container plastic container with a long cord running down to the bottom of the Arkansas River with a big piece of fatback tied to the end of it hopefully a snapping turtle would get a hold of that and you a big old catfish on a big old catfish out to every morning you're the goddess picking on me I'm saying nice things about you the best defense is a good offense I know you're offensive enough all right program director in 1979 in an interview recently I was talking about are talents that I'd really respected and I said you know Charlie tune in Los Angeles was my morning man there no Bailey in louiville John Lanigan and Cleveland the OMG Kelly would work for me in the LA is done morning for me in Las Vegas and some other places animated slip.and I said you know Bailey was probably the best morning man I've ever worked for and the interviewer said you said you worked for Bill and I laughed and said you know when you think about it I really did is Bailey was the boss let there be no mistake if Dylan wanted it it was going to happen and if he didn't want Phil to do something you had to find a creative way to get him not to do it they always prone to read your memos on the are you would sometimes do us the exact opposite of what you instructed him to do Choice Emily realize one day this is his Persona Bailey is the anti guy easy anti manager he has the contrarian he's going to go the other direction cuz that's part of his that it's part of who he is and once I realize that and went out of my way to give him the tools he needed to do his job we were really got along great why would probably say my first you're working with Bill was a real talent my second year I wish it was really very good how much is a Thursday morning just the most reading of 560 degrees 11 before 7 minutes before 7 a.m. with country music country music wow old dogs and children and watermelon wine make sure about to retire

they put me in charge around here now there aren't going to be any immediate changes I can promise you that catfish is doing a fine job there in the morning real nice YouTube singing love songs what are you trying to find the song of what is that Neil Diamond Barbra Streisand you don't bring me flowers 2:20 is our time at 59 wvlk the temperature is 53 until I get rid of this stuff it'll stain

present time but I shall overcome I can promise you that it's going to be such a pleasure working for such a nice people here the station and all you nice people out there in the Lexington area you have always said nice things about to Lexington some of the people in Louisville didn't catch you much about the things I said about Lexington because they always said that Lexington is the city on the role in the state of Kentucky beautiful city beautiful I love it here already it's a matter of fact I was on the telephone just before I walked in and call the mayor's office I said man this is the Duke he says bill it's a pleasure to have you here I said I'm pulling just to let you know I'll be available for consultation send the future and I want to know what love your community so much of already made a down payment with a real estate anyway I'm getting together with maybe talking about some of the things that I'm going to be doing for the city while I'm here and I think you'll find them of interest because you'll be participating also look at together with these things out over maybe lunch sometime in the near future bills with for years in afternoon drive at wvlk but it eventually became time to hang up the headphones I got to pay all up there, and came back with Louise on and when you lose your help you lose everything Bill Bailey's are work is going on to influence a new generation of broadcasters that at least I ever heard of it branded himself and X wklo disc jockey by identifying so much with the city that he worked in just not enough of that goes on in radio today it seems like a very simple programming cool and technique but he was the first to really take that and run with her I mean I think you really made an attempt to reach out and touch people whether does The Working Man or whoever he was trying to relay to at the time because he's the opposite of what a can syndicated Morning Show would be it would be diametrically opposite to that so that we can all learn from how he really reached out to the community and branded himself to the community director who hired Bill Bailey at radio wklo in Louisville in the 60s and me to dental school or law school or chiropractic school or Vietnam I too became a broadcaster and the point is not to talk about me but Bill Bailey truly it's difficult for me to separate what I believe I know about Bailey and Louis V and the few things I witnessed firsthand and the things that I heard of anecdotally and pure BS that I are others made up because Bailey is such a fertile field in which turd blossoms can flourish I mean who can deny anything you tell them about the Duke but I will say this I guess my dad's Tour of Duty is wklo program director was when I was in the shift the 7th or maybe 8th grade area I hadn't heard too many morning shows that knocked me back on my heels then when someone who my age at the time was in the early Elementary School in younger the recognize masters of all time and space at the time where Arthur Godfrey end on McNeil and I'm sorry they suck that was a grown up show those words shows done by Don McNeill on Arthur Godfrey for grownups and it was nothing in it for a kid Bailey and Danny Williams wky in Oklahoma city with the first two local morning radio performers I remember getting there were clearly doing adult programs but I got them I was a kid and I got their act and that was very different Bill and Danny have something in common a capacity for spellbinding keep you on the edge of your seat storytelling sometimes they take minute and minute to tell a story which I'm sure drove some program directors at some radio stations nuts of your silliness or experience into a few words over at 12 second Bailey and Williams Mike to few others in like some great song writers and filmmakers can give you the feeling they were following you around in your life taking photographs of your best moments in your worst moments who's showing the pictures back to you on the radio it's difficult to describe Bailey's success comes to some degree from his ability to Intrigue us all one at a time with a story a story a boring story even a bad joke you've heard a hundred times and his Common Man fax her he is one of us screw the boss that will embarrass my dad but hey Bailey's had more than a couple of ducks on through the years at the expense of his income bride or the bride's of others then to account for the Bailey phenomenon you also have to pour on a big Ladle full of Bailey's bigger-than-life missed his Star Quality it's not just the storytelling and it's not just the one on one human communication with other men and women who also work for a living and who also may enjoy a beer or a baseball game after work Bailey has a difficult to Define and nearly impossible to measure Ignace on the radio at the coffee machine at a betting window at Churchill Downs who in the world cannot listen to Bill Burr that's just a gift it's a god-given gift I've had more than my share of interesting jobs I've met lots of Fascinating People and sometimes famous people and had a lot of shout-outs sometimes from impressing people through the years but I've never ever ever been more thrilled that I was when I was a freshman Cadet at Missouri Military Academy Bailey said good morning to me on his WLS Chicago more I'd like to thank to do for that 35 + years later and I'd also like to thank to do for all the stuff I learn by listening to you that I don't even know how to describe in 1988 and out of work Bill Bailey gets it on Terry Meiners afternoon show on Louisville 84 WHAS to complain all the time you know it isn't my nature to complain like that I will complain about things you know that I was really a four and not against like a woman's live always liked women on manager George Francis it was always putting apologies and I want to apologize for Bill Bailey for saying this but saying that I have to tell them you this state is to say that Adam and he's going to apologize for my saying it but no I'm almost off and I was that's what they wanted they wanted hypercritical guy on the air that's what I was and when I left wacky and went over to WCI it was with the understanding I would no longer have to do that because I'm tired of it cuz there's a stigma that you have to carry when you do that you have a great segment of your audience who enjoys it and loves you for it but you've also got a segment of hates your guts for it I've had my life threatened several times. Twice he had a police over there bomb threats clear the radio station ain't going anywhere I think management wanted me to be blown up a couple of times but misunderstand what you said you had to be very careful how you word your statement because they will misunderstand I want to hear more about the broadcasting can do anything really but the landscape so I'm told open Wildlife but I seems to be dying out and the order now seems to be for a Landscapes I've done the ceiling in my garage I'm going to have to get by and see that sometimes I was on my bike but go on go on and it was something nobody can remember that Bill Bailey so perfect you talk about a radio personality is able to predict the same things going to happen to me first off Bill Bailey is a very difficult employee how do you in a dress that charge haven't asked anybody at work for and it's Bob Moody as Johnny Randolph I never heard anybody know I wouldn't do a thing like that I know I was never a typical employee you tell me what to do with buying program director guidelines for you the way you work tonight right as long as he was satisfied that the people that were Dependable that were efficient and he left them alone and it's nice to work for somebody like that ride you to death but you can't argue with that they destroy your enthusiasm okay Miss number or perhaps of meth number two and a half million dollars a year has the most vicious lie come to understand, whacking a wklo employees gathered along with family and friends to remember the time spent at Louisville's to gray top 40 radio stations of the 60s and 70s along with renewing old friendships we took time to honor one of the town's all-time great Bill Bailey so many careers in this room are you really stop and think about it do you need a gilded Joey Elias and you don't ask me about what they usually say oh yeah tell me about dude Walker name of time when they did not say Bill Bailey everybody asked about over the years and I remember reading book came out Bill's number one in number one in men and women aged 18 to 24 number one in men and women and do you know he was number one from the Cradle to the Grave and that's a true story and I don't think that's ever been done before and for sure it'll never be done again no one is really ever accomplished it little radio what Bailey is done for my career read the label Bill Bailey's all-time greatest disc jockey all right all right bro blue ocean animals all right I don't deserve not only that but if you want to argue about them as my wife feel better my day is a mega you making me cry. OK Google next up it was Mason Lee Dixon what state is called the Feast of Bowen he that outlives this day and come safe home will stand tiptoe when the day is named and Rouse him at the name of Bowen he that shall live this down and see old age will yearly on the visual piece his neighbors and say tomorrow is Saint Albans then when he stripped his sleeves and show his scars and say these wounds I had on Boeing's Dave old man forget that all shall be forgot but he'll remember with advantages what feeds he did this day and then she'll our names familiar in his mouth as household words Bailey the Duke Chris Lundy Johnny Randolph Gary Burbank and dude Walker weird beard makes you believe it should be in their flowing cups freshly remembered this story shelter good man teaches and Bailey Bowen shall never go by from this day to the ending of the world but we in it shall be remembered page 2 we few we happy few we Band of Brothers for he today that sheds his blood with me shall be my brother be he ne'er so vile this day shall gentle his condition and the Jefferson County now a bed jumping themselves accursed they were not here and hold their manhood cheap while any speaks that fought with us upon Saint Bowen's day next game waky general manager and be number one I've never run into so much talent at one time that went through wacky I bumped into people all over the country that know of this station and rightly so but a market in this country I don't think there is anybody better than Bill Bailey Renard a lot of people with great pipes and good feelings and a lot of talent but there was something just nicely. He about Bill come on there and almost swear you'd like it a preacher would say that's good stuff it's so good to see you and the recognition is a long time coming but I couldn't be more deserving good to say yes I was playing golf. Who you are recognized your voice he said you sorry son of a piano that's what you're talkin about he's just what he said he said well you been out to love with all your money away your kids not going to have a Christmas and if people would just bring some peaches or cans of corn by would be so grateful so I see you're kidding me he said it's so I get in the car. The preachers in the cans are going they weren't there but I figure around the corner and Bailey sees me Lisa's don't remember things I've been telling you about dude it's all a lies right outside the window. Haha he's the greatest place I have the words and I work to some great places and I just want to say that to me feel badly is the best disc jockey I've ever heard Johnny Randolph and Bill Crispin to the finest program directors ever work for I guess the broad also heard from Tim time it was fun to meet with the things about the clock that was another course we were the hot shots at the wacky radio and we all listen to him where we wrong want to talk about radio and I talked about this jockeys I was talked about Bill Bailey not tell stories about Bill Bailey because he never had a stick he was just bill it was like taking a ride in the backseat of a Louisville taxis are it didn't matter what morning I was in trouble as I'm done call me and tell me about something I don't know what it was and Bailey was standing on the chair in the studio ranting and raving about his divorce if you work today radio Rush Limbaugh no disc jockey did contemporary radio ever said on the radio when God made anybody else like Bill billion and built has a number of years ago sir Joe Biden from I feel a lot like the sixth wife of Henry the 8th on her wedding night I know what I'm supposed to do but I'm not sure I can make it interesting the luxurious radio career was Louisville and then you stopped every morning and going out and get this brain stop. I used to run into each other we had some of the same favorite watering holes and yeah we should get together there then one night I went into my Bill Bailey invitations trying to run a morning radio program I hope the boss any sites that young lady has looks just like I like them one on each side I said see their Bailey I can do but you can do me and I will never forget put a new bill that is certainly deserving in Forever send me play the last voice you ever hear be mine Bill Bailey wrapped up our 2005 interview with these words with me the way they did you know I went up to the advertising agency in the New York Eastern they want to know what name I program some popular I says well I think it's because nobody's going to take him away from me and that's exactly the truth I try to do a program that nobody's going to come in there with a new trying to take it away from me away from Gary Burbank or coyote Calhoun and if you never heard leave my squares on the air he surprised you. Lee was great I got my job done but I don't think of anything spectacular about me the job was to get an audience Devastation they sell figures figures you got to get an audience that we had the audience everybody return man we had everybody's Blue Collar White Collar teenagers everybody likes white we had just as many African Americans listening to us as we did a place at one point Roberts wa Klo to go out to WLS station was surrounded by black people going to keep me in Louisville that came right back. I'm happy with the way things work out I'm just happy that the best part of my radio career was that why cuz I'm happy I could be a part of it I don't think there's any way in the world man I work with were wandering around and finding another Gary Burbank and coyote Calhoun or John Randolph to work with a one-in-a-million John Randolph has a brain honestly I think he's the best program director I've ever seen you know John is always going to be there stranger, then East Haven I love the people that listen to me and I know they love me if I had it to do over again I'd do it the same way as a matter of fact I can't imagine myself doing anything else except painting pictures if I have a chance I like to do it again brand new Ismael I hear you this morning with the tools of my trade bottle of Alka-Seltzer in my beauty by my record I call upon the good Lord has mercy and wisdom on the golden carrier and take the old Duke home enjoyed Bill Bailey a louiville legend to all of those who contributed their time their memories and the recordings that have made this tribute possible and informing us all four more about Bill Bailey including photos or articles and Eric is it 79 whky.com and 1080 WK this is John Quincy
