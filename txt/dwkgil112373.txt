have been in have been here for almost six years I never seen quite the carnival-like atmosphere particularly on a holiday cuz this never happens we have a lot of guess we got a lot of a lot of people come out over over the last 34 years and usually I guess I guess we just take a lot of people for granted you know people that we think that you're going to be interested in hopefully and they're going to hold up for an hour and it usually works out that way Rod McKuen had an audience and that I was I was quite a mess because we're out here in the middle of nowhere in this weed patch in the San Fernando Valley but we had people in here this morning all I suppose but because they want to gawk at him but because they're so fond of him as a man and I can understand that too it a great people who don't have to be to work here at KGI out today they have a four-day holiday and the reason is Jonathan Winters and if I were Jonathan Winters I would be very pleased by that I'm sure I'm sure you do feel good about that people still care that much after all these years will deck you know that tripe turn my speechless momentarily I guess I am kind of piece was learned however a long time ago some 24 years ago when radio that you just don't want to be speechless for a ride to long-ass forever for very long because the manager says dead are as deadly but I can only tell you that I am momentarily kind of space inside I've been a big big fan of yours since I've been out here in California which is now going on Ten Years A little over ten as a matter fact I'm moving my family out here nine years ago but I was out here you're in a big pool and television but I love radio I love you and and your program and I'm not going to get carried away but I I started radio and we were talking about it earlier as you know back in w i n g in Dayton Ohio in our lifetimes who have changed the whole face of comedy one would be Lenny Bruce the lady Lenny Bruce would have been another one and Jonathan Winters I think Lenny and and Mort's would be would be called as soon as I have called but it's incredible I was reading an article the other day by Alan King he knows who talks about comedy always includes the name of Jonathan Winters you have had that Universal appeal from the very beginning and out of the the very beginning you were doing four things in the world started in Dayton Ohio Wing where you were this chalky 1950 I was in art school I was going to be an artist Deca I started out to to be a political cartoonist and then I went to a kind of graduated that into a commercial art and I thought somewhere along the line maybe I'd be a fine artist but I really looked at my work I had an exhibit in and do that exactly going on now but I I 2025 27 years ago I looked at my work and my wife who I bless your heart to got her Master's Degree at Ohio State to she looked at my work and she said she wanted to it's terrible stinks and I agreed with her I said you're right I said I'm not ready to go out into the Rodan and make a living and painting and I'll just have to hold off and wait which I did and waited until just a week ago to to have my first show it was well worth it and I feel now that it would if the timing was right it was a thing to do but anyway without going into a long thing I back in in 47 I was in a small School Dayton Art Institute in Dayton Ohio and I'm struggling as I say them that to be an artist and my mother was in radio she was old guy 30 years at w i z e in Springfield Ohio and so a lot of that rubbed off on me and her being and radio are being an actress in this neck and I went down I was living in Dayton of the time there was an amateur show going on at the Colonial Theater which is now gone might guy we were talking earlier by Gene Barry Gene by Halle Berry was probably the best DJ for my money in the Dayton area when I was a great guy and he was on this panel a judge he was one of the judges that evening at the Colonial Theater Jack Weimer Charlie reader and I wanted to other people and it was an amateur contest as I say for about a half a dozen of us and I had I had to watch for several years and I have my wife said you know you I'd read this thing in the paper about going down to audition and she said look you clown if you want to go to watch Canelo given to watch a way they gave away one of the cheapest watches I've ever encountered is it was a Gotham I've never heard of a gossip watch but I still have that Rascal and I'm going to put it in a little box frame I did the Indianapolis Speedway I did the sounds of the cars and then I did the characters they interview the characters a little bit while I Speedway that's an awful lot of lightning struck one of the cars and turned around and not coming by and how definitely then I went into Doo characters and I was on radio for just about a year right I remember I did a man on the street program that was one of the first things I did was called Gina women I'm going back a few years what can you do I know what do that job. What can you do and what it was it was a program which got the guy's jobs and it was a wild program because you don't ever forget that the sponsor and he was not a religious fanatic have on question and an engineer and I just happen to go down to say a little prayer before we went on and what is the true story and like I said to the man who the station I said look I ever learned was believing in God and then what have you but I said there's something about kneeling down in this man's department store with my engineering which chips is my right I need some luck your clown you just go ahead and do it it's it's money and it's a half an hour and we need the bread so I did it and then television came into the Midwest as you know and your people are Universal because not only are they funny but there there's a love we love your people because quite frankly I think we love Jonathan Winters and it's that shouldn't embarrass you because I know you can understand that we love the person doing these characters therefore we accept them as as you are friends now. They develop that w i n g the characters of a lot of them dead Granddad I'm fortunately with little time I worked actually harder on the characters in with the characters it if you will love and I guess that's the term and it took me several years to really kind of find them it's like a puppeteer working with a marionette to master those strings but you can really move in my arm move that little dollar or character and death are ventriloquist it's the same thing with them but the guy that does voices do you work with him and you home that late until it's really sharp Grand Moff record started out in in Dayton Ohio on my aunt God Rest her soul was 80 something years old about 85 and loop perks she was a product of Ohio my grandmother's sister and she was a great old gal have Snow White hair ever since I can remember was a cripple and she about where was able to get around she up spending a great deal of her life in bed because of our problem with her legs but you had a great fantastic always give me a little glass of wine and some fudge and so I shan't we would exchange stories together and she taught me how to play poker she was a break and from her I put together to wish as you know it is almost Christmas time and I'm painting cards again and I do these little simple because I'm a simple person I made it seven years old and I'm dating a 21 year old boy who's a lot of fun as a good sense of humor and it runs fast and it goes down to the grocery like a bullet as I'm sure by this time you know it's 9:19 1:19 Continental we have a name for all the letters praising our hostesses we call them orchid letters one of our girls Dawn Dobbins has received over 180 flower shop send on Dobbins is a girl to remember on Continental Airlines flight to remember okay one more here Jonathan what I do John you got understand this I take other's talents and use it as my own and people say what a wonderful time of the year and being a dick Whittington and I certainly wouldn't be the case 9:20 bringing the reproductions of the Phoenix police are good cuz I'm going to do that to your convenience bullets do open Sundays from noon to 5 reflect the joys of Christmas with get some bullets they made it a tradition to gather a wide variety of gifts of the you be sure to find something special for each and everyone on your list enduring bullets holiday sale now in progress you'll find best savings and everything from Fashions to furniture shop Sunday's noon to 5 p.m. at Bullock's when we do one more gen weekend sometime Tropicana hotel in country club in Las Vegas Pearl Bailey.

Dobbins fly with you and Continental flights to Kansas City your choice of two deadly nonstops on Continental Airlines flight to remember Continental when it comes to his other remarkable talent in that is that he is a painter talk about it over the years but we've never really seen anything about his work from time to time we have a mutual friend I have seen one penny a sandwich and I have seen some of Jonathan's work but you have the opportunity, what is the name of the art gallery gun charge on it's the ancrum art gallery ankrum on La Cienega trying to find the radio station also with an account executive will call them that they just briefly you went down to see Jonathan's work obviously you're a fan of Jonathan Winters is the very place that Jonathan is as nice as I had hoped he would be in it even nicer but the beautiful thing was that I knew you look at the paintings and you start to laugh and then you look at them a second time and you say hey he's really saying something and he really is he's really very very good that the titles are unbelievably well listen to birds watching door stays cat and dog drowned another one a little on the serious side is cold water gate to 1973 I must and I'll try to describe on radio on a little what the pennies like it's a fairly good-sized painting II right the hand I I don't know the exact measurements but to the largest certainly would have the paintings I do it's a white telephone and of course ladybugs on the telephone and then on the receiver red white and blue representing the Country of Hearts on the side of the phone representing the heart of the nation of number one signifying the opposite of the of the president and then people coming out of the the telephone number of people that again the country and the people involved in Watergate and then a wire the telephone wire running to a large ladybug and write in tiny tiny letters why is not quite attached to the ladybug mats for a reason because still the president is not labeled guilty and so there's a maybe a 16th of an inch between the two wire and below that water Bluewater other titles at Wounded Knee and I and actually I have for some time felt very seriously and still am about to be ending situation the American Indian here and in this country and I I work with the energy to know I won't go into a long thing about that but I never resented you you do an Indian character you're getting all because I've talked to various minorities and I just Indians but other minorities about things with regard to my doing a characters and they said that Ricardo Montalban a friend of mine once said I asked him and he said fine my friend you do one but remember to do it with taste and dignity and I always remember that don't make a sad but it's under a tree with a jug of booze in her lap you know and in our life soon and prepare a sad way to give us some dignity and that is a people we aren't so that's what I've always remembered and then try to do that at one here called the thoughts of a Hollywood actor while drowning in his pool looking through a keyhole at her like a rat fink my Christmas cards this year and then the snow and then there red birds in the snow and one bird died when red bird has a key in his back and serious side effects of quiet little kind of porcelain like town could be anywhere with little green grass and little yellow flowers and in the center of the pictures of bomb falling its first date first day of War then they are there two more here one is called I just won the first job opening opening day of deer season and it's a it's a better comment on pending and I feel very strongly about that I used to hunt myself I never hunted deer animals are hunted bird which is just as guilty of pheasant rabbit and 25 years ago I hung that up and put them away and put the guns in that stuff about tub I think I could never see very much and what kind of guy could take of important for my 360 Magnum to a long rifle ammo what a telescopic sight in the 2,000 yd kill a deer I think if you're going to kill a deer then they take a knife and run after him you're just as guilty for my money what I mean like I bear you no go to bear fighting hand-to-hand see what happens a lot of those cats Hard Rock at midnight there's a full moon there in this check guy is doing his thing in front of the microphone at Midnight Special they really are and again that's just another facet of the of the man who hasn't talked that much about to start I guess you had kind of them are you rarely have inferior about you are that you have no no I hate this current show that says I say running at the anchor in gallery as represents three years work and there's some almost 60 paintings in the show some 30 some Thirty paintings writings are still still for sale I had an opening here just this past Sunday and I tell you that kid was a tremendous role for me and I had somebody asked me they said my guy should say the amount of stars that came out of without a doubt say there was only one of the time in my career and my life with the thrill was equally as important as great in that was the of the opening of its a mad mad mad world. Stanley Kramer's picture of them with all the comedians in the whole thing on that that evening with the church lights in the sky was the last big Hollywood opening that I can remove and though I really you know I like my gosh this is that man you are finally arrived and then to walk into that theater and see myself on the screen I was like a child at boarding play from Baton from Dayton to New York I never gave up I really and I'll be very honest with you there's no reason to lie to you I I never dreamed I'd come this far I thought that I could make a living somewhere along the line I was convinced I could do that and I mean within the business but I never dreamed my wildest dreams that I know I never come this far as my wife and bless your heart. I always believed in me and she stuck by me through a lot of lot of problems and which go along with success and the times I Shake Rattle and Roll But to hang in there and she hung in there with me and I think a lot of guys as you know only too well come up this funny ladder and what that lady that started with them and it's 25 bucks a pop you know ende Hamburger here and helping a little hot plate and they made a Starlet somewhere in downtown LA the little lady in the car and sweater goes and so I am 5 Years and we're still looking to one another and then if you don't hear it. Everything is out here in these the general manager of a of a drug company are they drug you have a name Dean Miller. The guy that you remember from Dayton Ohio these are names that Jonathan would know that I'm going to get inside of it is every calling for me y'all not too long ago that story that even in Dayton if you had two people in a saloon that you were performing I'm afraid that's true day and no I didn't mean to embarrass you with that but that evidently led to a long time when do I find out that there weren't the best audiences in the world and alleys in washrooms and some of the better hotels and I'll never forget to that was a great friend of mine has a black cat unfortunately had to work in a washroom and I'd come in from time to time and he was in a bar in one of the better hotels and I would tell him about the problems of the black people are black rhaetian and he finally just turn them I said hey man I got to make some money yet please you no go away and I have you later on I wrote to him and he said I'm glad you shaped up but I had to pay some dues everybody does. And I think it was about twelve years ago then I really got my head on straight and it took a little bit of living one time this was such a hungry I in San Francisco and you were run that you were funny that night of course but you are also very serious and it was a murmuring in the back of the room and by the time you got to a point where I can figure out that was a reasonably close and I can figure out what's wrong with him today when when you when you go out somewhere or just you or I I had a person to say something that you here quite often in this business and leave them in the funny guys really are an awful lot next to the weather weather person in the night and they turn to a man they said in the middle of a conversation that are you being serious now and I do not sure it's how I am and they said well I can't tell and I fight in the old days I would have really bugged me and and made me so it made me mad but I realized I took into consideration that with many people and this person certainly include the only time they see you is when you're being funny so why should they suddenly believe believe you you know what I was being serious but certainly all my friends and a great many of my fans know exactly when I'm being serious I'm serious about many things about obviously the end of the movement I I don't get into it and unless I mean to get into it because I'm I'm definitely interested and it it's a big part of my life up but I don't have a lot of flags I don't believe in that I'm doing in my own little quad way what I can type but you don't feel the compulsion anymore is it constantly be on no I don't do I find it there's a time to be on a time to be off and when I get into my funny little car when I leave here I'll be off I won't be a dressed-up as a medieval Knight in my front of the wagon I'll be in my regular clothes in the old days I am in one time I I was bombed out of my bird I was I left the studio and New York and was dressed as Grandpa Frank and it's about 15 18 years ago and I drove up the West Side Highway and their two tow stations in a s o station I decide to have a little fun and Mr quarter I'm going into the basket and he said Madame would you get that quarter and I hit him with some language of attorney Marino and he was really shaken are you telling me anything you a clown a bad words and he was literally shocked out of his britches and stopped me and then we're going to call over there please my finally talked him out of there is this goes back I guess what are the first time that I saw you can we all have all have favorite Jonathan Winters things that undoubtedly be my favorite or anybody in this room or anybody listening has a Jonathan Winters favorite could I do that for this cuz I haven't heard this in such

unprofessional as you can possibly be but since my whole Act is unprofessionalism Big John I'm not even going to apologize for the hell it I'm just going to ask whether it's possible I can say that I think most people even referral this business when you watch somebody working in comedy your analyzing and I think it's more stalls line in this time we don't laugh at things we say amen that's funny hey that's funny and that's the kind of reaction that you get you did a piece of Grandma flickered and the picnic and I I don't think I can ever remember myself doing this ever again and I never before I was actually on the floor I'm rolling on the floor with tears in my eyes and I can I duplicate that I haven't I haven't done the picnic for quite a while but I'll try really damn the best my ability to put it back together it's a typical thing that I assume that the most people go through in the spring or summer no matter where they live in the country of a picnic and a little bit of funny a group of people love Grandma and the mother and the husband and three or four children a rather unusual step brother and a doggie Kitty and the one of the neighbors and they're in a pickup and they're driving along and the conversation is listen now let me tell you something Lamar let's find a place to stop pretty soon I've asked you 15 times 15 times has been a lot of beautiful correction rivers or lakes your past them trying to find a place I want to go swimming I told you not to lean against the dog I told you not to I will pull over pretty soon now you put a curse on the car I got a blowout alright get up mom come on that's all you get out to let's let's go get it I don't just stand there with your finger in the air bring some groceries dad do you want to help out dad alright I love you get up again that big trail when I get a picture of it come on come on what are you doing where are you know somebody you're you put too many too much pepper on these hard boiled eggs Mom know everybody got over the picture where is baby Elizabeth not get an erection Mercy the baby just spoke to them Hornet stung at Justice buddy just this morning now it's been a long time since John on on your your present television show night to television shows that I can recall when the NBC 15 minutes I think that is why did network is quiet didn't work I I don't put the blame on anyone first I think that's a mistake I I put the blame on myself really not on certain never on my actors are the people that have been with mirror or help me I think that's the problem was that I found that the best thing for me was improvisation and has nothing to do with it for that matter with writers are a lot of great writers fantastic writers but for me and for my bag I'm in that world of improvisation I do it in my painting and I do it in my comedy to just ad-lib we're doing here that's that's the fun thing for me and for me to do jokes and lines with exception of maybe theater or or a movie then night and I stretched Stickley to that script when I do a picture can always record you're coming out in front of the curtain in front of the shell are doing an introduction to one of your guests and I always felt at that moment because Jonathan Winters is the kind of a man that you feel compassion for you feel empathy you can almost feel the butterflies in your stomach as you're watching him and much like Sid Caesar you were incredible in that role as very true but the man who had to walk to be the host to the station and I'm at home when I'm in my characters I don't pretend to be Paul polish and coming out good evening ladies and gentlemen and I'm so happy you could be there I want to get right to the meat of the thing and I believe very much but I don't mean to get into a long plug for my show but the Wacky World of Wonders which is senior on CBS on 7:30 on Monday night is it is it at least from my way of thinking is that is the best crack at it at television that I've had because if nothing else goes down the tubes and Lord knows I hope it doesn't. I think we would have done very well around the country where in trouble momentarily was Monday Night Football what's going in January but I must confess I'm a little inclined to switch over myself and wondered what those big rascals are up to but at least I Did It My Way it's been a ball I I want to give credit to Greg Garrison with my producer that sounds like you know you're accepting some kind of an award but I want to give credit I always have if I ever got a crack show like yours is to a gal who's a fantastic actress and who is help me when I'll order so much well her name is Mary Gregory she's the gal my show that is a regular running G was on the show was a great time I'm sure you know Ronnie he's up doing Theater now it's Marian Mercer up in in Seattle and I've had a number of fantastic guests but I must say that Mary Gregory is just want to do something because this is very commonplace you were always like Precious and these are stories of her why people want to help you as much as they do like for the art gallery the Lord for people that lost her heart to hurt you know that they're going to keep this whole plan on going I believe in people I'm not one of these guys at two lives under a black cloud I I just love people for the most part they're they're somebody's around we all know that they don't stick around for somebody to long you know you usually get at them would you mind telling what it's going to be like when they have to go back East to write on a kind of a resale place over show how to promote the show and you know do some newspaper articles and do some shots on TV and promoted a little bit get it going to be tough but I'm a product of the middle west end the midwesterners as you know like the westerners are very down-to-earth people very basic very American that sounds like the last page of Readers Digest let them they are and I figured for the most part very warm and very and very talkative going to a drugstore barber shop at AJ s what's what's happening in I went to New York in 1953 and I'll never forget I've been there as a child and holder a several times so I wasn't a complete rube I knew where the Empire State Building was I seen it the Statue of Liberty stand there for 2 hours and go off or ask a question where is it but I had $56.46 I've gotten off the plane that's all I had I was married one child my wife and boy were back in the big city I went into the Biltmore men's bar with January 1953 and I sat down beside a guy typical New Yorker with at that time the mirror in his hands and was about noon he was having a glass of beer I don't know what I was having I hope the same at the time I hope they're right and I turned to him and I it was my first arrival and they are good as well as an actor as a comedian are there to work in a and I said say hi my friend I have the Rangers do and he looked at me and he said I got a nickel that was my opening shot from then on I got real tough metal plant stand up at eight million people on an island and have a very happy we'll be straight between Montana excluding transportation for Volkswagen I'm solid Chrysler engineering that doesn't sell safety sure it really pays to pick up Plymouth Duster at your Southern California pipe for the Plymouth dealers yeah one more here for Rose Sally's this Delicatessen we've been telling about the all-time restaurant and Delicatessen over in Woodland Hills that we discovered accidentally and I think because of that we've had the opportunity to talk about this place after yesterday not thinking too much about food but sometime over the weekend and you like that like it's like corned beef and all the good things that great smell of the other Delicatessen you walk in and it's just fun by itself I think you'll find the biggest sandwiches you've ever had at Starlight she's got to work harder for it because he's new and therefore he tries harder it looks like a restaurant doesn't have the year the look of it.
