you know I have never I don't think as long as we've known each other and exact and I we work before in the other stations and probably will a gain on another station and I have never ever followed you and never realize that you've got something wrong with your hearing well if you got to crank it so you got to see my gray cells and synapses don't fire is like they used to be important and I'm telling you I never thought in my life that I would be honoured by a brewski brewski because as a salute to j.j. Jackson and the edge the last 2 hours are brought to you commercial free by our friends at Budweiser brand spanking new from the car is that not a brilliant piece of music a Michael biehn Scott music in the boys from the call is Brandy new with a brand-spanking-new song you're not going to be until next week the great song in the last song that we played before we take it on out of here then I'll make sure you're paying close attention to the lyrics as well okay then from Bali we sincerely were and will be again the best in the west 101.9 can always go out take a nap and take a nap Peter Gabriel Walk Through the Fire Fire Woman comes from the cuz that's the New York City remix here on the edge and we've got our favorite lady how you doing it's really sad right now it's actually just amazing we will look very sad I think yesterday and then that doesn't mean that we're still not tried today but it's just that overwhelmed with the the facts and the other the letters and the calls it's which one's been lit for 3 days and the people have just been so supportive and Incredibly intelligent and wonderfully well written letters and fax things in it I just been completely blown away and because of all of that unless I think that it's possible we might rise again and hopefully in the near future you radio station has is meant to my career I'm I'm coming from Los Angeles having lived there for 48 years and hearing it and you were the first and only fishing to play it for him for a long time because they were stupid and waiting for research why do you like that my Grammy nominations you noticed it being me in the street down then and I know that that's where the people heard it and that's where the whole combination comes from its it's what they here or are we love you we recognize your talent when is going to rain anytime when a person gets behind a microphone and they can make the little hairs in the back of your neck stand up in a little Goosebumps jump out of your arms and then that person got a lot of talent and if there's any way in hell that week in there and put that over the airwaves let other people hear that and feel the same thing I mean that's the one thing is basically all we are is a conduit you know and that's what with a radio station that plays music should be as a conduit hopefully we've got good ears and I've got to stop and try to make amazing years and if we've got good ears and then we lay it out to the public then if it's a true product as yours is. If it's something true in a real heart then they'll pick up on it and that's why you cannot get working getting close to being Platinum now aren't you of course you know any success but at the same time that I just love you to do so down-to-earth and I we love you here we certainly will meet again to make sure that we're up and running September cuz we can't we can't drink so much Melissa the coming all the way from Tulsa to be late as hell back then alright we love you Melissa Etheridge Los Angeles the following Melissa Etheridge has the most welcome phone calls from Tulsa Oklahoma we went into Melissa live with bring me some water what you did to live at the Roxy back in October in a broadcast on this very station and we were quite proud to do so and then we moved into you to live with the Maggie's Farm that's why I meant I will meet you to get a nose record stores that carry the hard to find things there's quite a few here in Los Angeles Glendale and I'm sure in Orange County as well so check it its called live from Ireland and a big benefit concert and having a few years back you two new version of Dylan Maggie's Farm was Bono coming on Rockets this is about working with the Irish band clinard in this one's very smooth very pretty 101.9 the last night before we fall off the edge Spanish gold big big son of course I sounded very much like the place needless to say they were influenced by the police and the song stop the world would come to dunsinane from Macbeth this is what you got and if the entire album with CD single it was sent to us a right away and then I guess the album will be released real soon the entire album is indicative of this particular Captain it's going to be a good one to take him a long way the police in front of that the police not Sting the police with their version of I burn for you I think version is quite different this version comes from the soundtrack of the film Brimstone and treacle now I'm talking about this only because of the fact that I've gotten an awful lot of appreciate that and it's wonderful but it is a cymbal a cymbal a wonderful now the reason I say that is because when you've got musically if you're a musicologist and you've got musicologist on your staff and people who love the music as we all do then you get all this wonderful input so that was Randy Thomas the Train me onto van particular version of I burn for you and then and that's just keep tapping me logic does that well we have for somebody on the phone that called up to you and I both like a lot and are you doing all right this is a nice surprise pillow wow no isn't this this this isn't him Willie I'm so glad I did when you were down here before and you did the show with Jim I was one of the most mesmerizing times I've ever heard on the radio and we just I'm just flattered and just pleased that you would come by the station for us in that it as you did and just sit and seemed like you had a really good time and what happened with them they're getting rid of that I will rise again actually with your what we doing mister Dixon is with doing one of those New Orleans kind of you know Louisiana type of wakes you know if you know what I'm saying I know because I was kind of disappointing where you mean give me a complete or what exit is it in the management decided to go and do nothing nothing bad I don't think you're going to like that letting us have at least this last night thank you so much and I'll let you get back to you is his last part of the show here but thank you for calling that's a real honor for for both JJ and I will never forget it that it is I won't forget this in a lifetime will because of your music has made an awful lot to anybody got some pretty good leads oh well we'll see and will certainly keep you informed and you'll be on the very first show of the day we can come back on the air all right all right I can't get out of calling you mr. Dixon I'm sorry I just got that much back thank you that's great, my way here and then when you got people like I'm feeling really good today Melissa call Willie Dixon call Peter Frampton called when I was about by all the letters in fact everything we got from if I could write I know how eloquently you speak real Juju but like I said it was it was ready and so Cynthia function I was sitting down talking about that and we were very clever enough to put Cynthia Fox on the show that we had called A Cut Above on Sundays it was really for the Rock audiophile and I think I started the show and logic to it as well but I think even logical to admit neither of the two of us should did it as well as Cynthia and she just came in and just turn this on all this good music so what I would do is after Sunday I would look through her playlist and look through the little box of things that she had yes and I said yeah let's listen to that if I hadn't heard it or if I heard it on her show headed to the playlist this is one of those in this is from the soundtrack of the film Echo Park Lord knows that's true
