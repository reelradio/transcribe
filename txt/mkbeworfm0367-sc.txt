we have a very very special young gentleman who I have known for a number of years and I'm sure most of you know the name I mean you all know what relationship is played in the musical world and we are very happy to welcome Brian Epstein of England toWWE Sandman are microphones Brian it's a delight to have you on the show and all that kind of questions that I have to ask of you and so many things that I want to ask I think that perhaps we'll just do them as they come along to the begin with what everyone seems to have had a a new direction to be one is going through their own matriculation I guess and have reached a certain maturity and in musically I'm speaking able to articulate a whole new meaning as far as concept of music music and musicianship and your involvement in England not only with the Beatles that was too many other groups as well in your own career since I haven't really sad to speak with you about this and any length of the years difference Laden has been great in many fields what how is it changed as far as your own thinking your own Direction has there been a change for you to swim or when I first came over here with bit of Crema I am used to people in New York and then after that beginning of 1964 it'll break down that was when we first met and really it was beyond everything that cuz I didn't know what was going on it was 1 when I try to send something with common sense as much as anything else capture success with the records so I'm believe one day sentence was so great time I'm just crying they want was going on to it in between times on this been able to find out what has been going on and what has taken place and I'm seeing progression not only with the Beatles but with lots of other people so I think things much better now and then why when you first came over this is been a being in the midst of it I seem to notice it all the time that the times that I've had traveled with you that it was almost like you weren't involved in it like you were just observing this fantasy this if it's like it was very as you said very unreal get it was just too immense are too big and I think as a manager I've noticed that this happened you I don't think you went into that the management business I gather as just for the sake that this was your business and your livelihood it but really that you are appreciated music Doug music and love music a great deal. And the little poster for long time since he has the thing that I was getting bored with doing that cuz I could anticipate I want to try for this while Spanish and came back and then the Beatles thing happened but that was a long time ago that was 9061 long time to break through I think the day it takes long time to break through with anything that's where the enforcers nothing is really important spreading through very quickly except you can find many of you all listen is probably won't know about Jimi Hendrix Who by the way has nothing to do with me you can take for some for Jimmy and he's broken through big now and I supposed to the general public in England it looks as though it's an overnight success but no Style success is born overnight Jimmy hung around the village and around Detroit and around Master places around States before anything really happened to him before someone took an interest and brought him I was running errands and now he is very important Liam I've heard a lot about my table will do right about here is except play record which is not released here in the in the states or is it is his Jimmy's will we have it cuz I'm a guest English record that we do but we have is not explicit give Allison has an opportunity to hear what Brian talking about this is Jimi Hendrix version of Hey Joe that is not representative Jimi Hendrix Jimi Hendrix Hey Joe I think it's good good age as good as he is basa and he's a great performer set alarm you telling me that he plays a guitar with wooden teeth with feet with his with his amplifier he bashed his tube out but it's not a gimmick thing smashing up guitar notes which lot of people do it's just that he can play with the thief he is an age guitarist speaking of musicianship the one thing that I guess about the Beatles not think that I'm sure that there are many lessons here and I'd like to get to Nitty Gritty type of questions and get that out of the way so that we can proceed into a into other areas The Beatles and your relationship and the your projection as far as they are concerned because you still we still get let his other job broken up and that it's more or less sometimes people hear news sometimes it here to smattering of news myself that there's no one who was the closer to the situation and more involved and I thought perhaps you just tell us what the present status is Fright The Beatles in their career and your own involvement strange rumors about them right now I'm done I didn't really know how big the rubbish iruma got out in Arizona Beyond and above the five of that I didn't realize that I'm not coming over on the airplane to have a sister who is very pretty and very nice can sit down and the first thing she said was that well that breaking up now I'm there this was fight account let you know mom thought she had decided that this what happened in her own mind what are you going to America fall but this wasn't true at home it was just a skosh the room is in London with various names in the boys said that because it was stupid or the one thing which you probably didn't realize I remember he know there was always a roommate each week about the Beatles back in the more hysterical days in 64 65 and the printed the stories about the Paul getting married and that puts him ending up being the only one that hasn't been married and so that most of the time on the air was trying to find out what the true facts were but here it had really had developed to a point where I was even starting to be brainwashed they had talked about when you're no longer going to be connected and they're going their way and there was a story here last week and a magazine or in a newspaper was in a newspaper which state is about Paul saying that it's all over for us now it would definitely it's definitely over and he's going to be spending his time in the recording studio making records and puttering around the house and all that kind of jazz and then the room is got into more within the trade and and went into the public about the fact that the two had a new manager or they going to have the manager and maybe they were going to make a picture in and then all of these things about George going to India and doing a whole bit they are with the sitar and Davis hung up on Indian music and that John was going to do a picture in Carla career as an actor and so I think that it's about time that I think the people should know what what has happened to me what is taking place in the past say month or so with regard to new contracts and and all that kind is it last year in our touring wise I think it was the hottest ever because we visited countries which we've never been to before Japan the Philippines know that the broken by which was very difficult and very hard and I accept responsibility if it was actually none of our faults and then we have the American tour in the Christ business which was sort of thing which was taken out of context which we would all they wanted about said that I didn't think that it's wonder if any of them after that what you might call a long vacations folded in fact Ryder films. Enjoy several weeks I'm John did make a phone which is very good by the way even regular ones at the time just to spend the condoms right but this is all over and changed and I wasn't very hard to find a straight. I was surprised because I've I know of three tracks I've had three facts and they've actually, they've got nine done he told me but the nine of going to be completed to knows these various things are going to be put on some some some nine is the Mark I didn't know whether than in that is including the two at the moment I'm dealt with the singles on although I wish they wouldn't really have five minutes with capital is 12 sq ft single or not but I hope it doesn't because it's Strawberry Fields Forever and Penny Lane Sterling care Fest in the last few singles so it'll be very nice from Erica if we didn't put on the two singles good something I mean well I didn't like to Shutterfly being particularly a Swanky about fixing to ask you a question about their attitude and your own personal attitude about it cuz the fact that is a lot of people now will pick out of their material by Norwegian Wood which we played great dealer I just seen if there's any thought of the great things out of the Rubber Soul album and the tremendous we actually had two songs like Tomorrow Never Knows and there's 12 which is a big favorite of our own teams that Paul guys did with the particular to say I think it's in the album was it is. I had a break since you wakes what is that I'll take the title probably after but it it it shows that they have it at that definite idea and purpose in mind that musically post expressing themselves as musicians and as as artists of doing certain kinds of numbers that working every night in the studio I really enjoy every single night if if the Fashions of ever been canceled in the last month so they've been for particular reason I just have Saturday and Sunday night so anybody else but they're the most likely will do another show the television show around the album to Showcase up and after that we're going to make a film I'm very anxious thinking about how do we have ideas I mean when I say we have ideas I didn't say that vaguely we've got the death might I just needed to vent and rooftop definite ideas as to who should develop its way to come definite ideas about what store from director should be involved did the thought of doing a personal appearance to her I had we had quite a long conversation I had with Paul Simon was the last time that he was on and some of the things of course that happens to every artist who gets acceptance by protecting them into you have a few phenomena that happen Sinatra Presley in the Beatles I guess for the big three of the past 20 years anyhow but in either case I would imagine that where they they've already done that bit of having 50 some-odd 0-60 some 1,000 people in a in a ball python hysterical and go out there and just play and as the boys off and said you know they were watching the people just as much of the people watching them just a reaction you know but it would seem that since they're doing so many groovy things in writing so many things and have so much to say that it would seem to me that maybe one of the reasons that they would want to do a tour of that kind of tour again would be because I think they've got something more to say then getting Mass hysteria this is the kind of I didn't think that you'd get any one of those of them all me to Casa Garcia State that they will never appear in public again no because of the pendulum aspect but because it will be very difficult to progress from those sort of toes and then in case this is my personal point of view how creative a satisfactory for them all those tools except in terms of Finance they don't really think too much but I'm going to be leaving to me anymore but I understand it very well so there's no reason why they shouldn't appear in public again but I didn't think that it will be in the concept that we have known previously but I think to that that's just in keeping with them that's why I'm getting your account your ID and your concept seems to be moving to have a definite again a definite rapport with those of the boys because I know we always sit together and talk things over and it's great that you're both moving you and your managerial capacity and then their artistic capacity seem to be going to the same or traveling the same road I find that this has happened to everybody in the book that I wrote and I only say it because I'm not even certain that I've done that I'm thinking of the next one but I'm but I think the one thing that I did is that they had set pattern their attitude probably was the most important thing there is there are Pros to people all kinds of people with their be the grass or royalty or or a certain ambassadorial parties in there if they're completely being unimpressed except by the person and what it was they said at a definite impact could all really did have an impact and I think their attitude and being able to not take themselves seriously in other words and I remember this star as of yesterday and they did sit back in your Play Store the boys I've never done that and I think it's their attitude has been probably the one single Force which has had a tremendous amount of influence not only on musician thank you and performance but also on the the average American, and gout and their approach to life and their demand really for honesty cuz I think that's one thing I thought of all the things that have anyone would ask me about my relationship for knowing them and knowing you was a complete honest approach I mean d George particular he doesn't have never made a statement which you could say was dependent upon something else they've made out of context is difficult for people to accept but on the other hand I do speak honestly with the Marine Cleve thing tonight I I know it perhaps but you said that you perhaps it refer to the statement about Christ which by now just for your own edification as far as I was concerned since it was taken out of context and I did read the entire statement at the time that it happened it's something we getting a lot of people can curl with so much so that the second part of my book which I'm doing is a is all about religion It's s pies called God is not dead the church is and in it I think John Lennon has AR headset has probably prompted more things I'm more of a realization because all throughout the United States and every kind of denomination people are reaching out other two I'm not as think about the church itself and the progressive a people of all denominations Progressive clergy are looking for ideas not from theologians than but rather from people who say well how can we relate they've they've done contrived and they tried but it's at its come out as a contrived as a play rock and roll music in church is not to attract the young but then when you get them there what is it how you how are you related to what you're doing and I think what he has said is true it is that they have lost out and get him to have been more people buying Beatle records and going to see Beetle movies and and then there has been new people going to join and become a member of a church but most about that the interview the initial until I was done in his own home was Maureen kill you fool we've known you play Travelers on the 31st torious Bryant and you know he said these things and she was right to report them but I think the water upset John more than that nothing else was the hundreds of people think that John has a very sympathetic person and the last thing was he would want to do would be anybody's feelings however he may feel field knocked down smash all the people on it see what it was amazing cuz when I heard it was met her in England in fact she did a nice piece I mean I know that you was at one of the big beatlefan there it was on the phone every few seconds the same what could I do and how can I help in some safe but it seems it becomes a matter of a fact that the Press is not particularly interested in trying to get an explanation and give a full explanation they had something Sensational to go on that something finally to put down these kids will play loud music as far as they're concerned those people who I really turned off to today and I'm not talking about being a hippie or anything cuz I mean really today's world and I thought that I think it was there and the day obligation was to have the first person who should have been interviewed should have been Marine Cleve to write what she had said but which they took out of contact but they weren't looking for that I mean you heard about DJs across the country like the band Beatle records of know if you saw that night crazy movies with the next thing worth of Toby beetlemuse is still important but it seems such as showing year of the people behind the press all out of touch with today they didn't realize things my radio and television has almost taken my place and Armstrong Jones said the other day that he couldn't understand why this rumor about him breaking out with Princess Margaret have gone out to let me know is his actual quotes were pretty hot because they were so really he talked about the gossip rest of Europe has been saying this for us ever since he was he was saying that sort of thing and he couldn't understand it because I haven't dated in England because it hasn't broken big enough and your but he did say that and I think that he had a right to say that because it's just named you Sensational names and Sensational stories to be built on the phone I think perhaps what you say is that best exemplifies that radio and TV as information sources when you write something in a newspaper it's hearsay and rumor and people proud sort of change the printed word and tradition and years I guess teach you all this is it you know after after while people for example I'm not believing that history books either cuz they don't believe that the true story has been written about the American Indian for example of him or the over the Negro in this and what really what happened there at the house but the people that wrote those books I know I'm not so cheap fast food on sale papers on a daily basis as well even there there alright let me say certain things that were kept out that we're and included that should have been, saying that they had but here in the press the reason that radio and TV is has taken up a great deal of slack is that people can hear it for themselves see it for themselves here the entire conversation for themselves here in newspaper they write whatever they want they can take you out of contact and therefore they can paint even though Lord Snowden said it it seems like a sort of half-hearted kind of routine denial because they did not issue the full text of what he had said they just broke the same we're okay we're going to take a couple of moments and I think this is about time to play some Beatles sounds and I'd like to wrap that up some of this will play with a vehicle sounds quite an interesting thing there was a survey of which we pay no particular attention to on our show only because we don't believe it we believe in our own audience reaction and when the Strawberry Fields Forever and Penny Lane came out we were in a a sampling here and we took something like a couple of thousand votes was in a 40 minute. And Strawberry Fields Forever had one bio about a hundred and some-odd wrote the first day of 6th and we waited until the survey same survey and again for everything goes one so that's as far as we're concerned there any Lane is number one it's going to that tomorrow and he's like a mouse Strawberry Fields was perhaps the one which some of my friends would go from the Penny Lane was definitely the mall commercial whatever that mean yeah. Is that all that interpretations of beetles in the spirit of The Beatles 67 sound I'm playing God show me the music we are just played The Beatles sounds 1967 is there any kind that would you say that there is a compatibility in the forthcoming album with those two sounds are there further expressions of types of music lyrical content there are they are amazing in the sense that I think they personified their impetus I think it was only the Beatles whose every record became so different and its approach and of exploring new things that's saying something which is so it that tune to today and what's happening today so aware of today that this has made for the greatest amount of fusion between the folk field The Rock feels so that there is everybody's and everybody else's mind to everybody else's thoughts and art free of that no longer very used to it was a great deal of prejudice I know how it was an England but it has been a great deal of prejudice here in the past about the various categories of music is the Beatles helped a great deal and starting an impetus that broke down the so-called prejudices and various so that everybody could appreciate what everybody else was doing I even acknowledge it the one person it was a John and George and Paul who had made me aware of that Dylan existed that ground 64 and the fact that a deal is big fan of The Beatles the big deals were fans of Dylan and then not carry dealer not caring if they booted Newport was all of a sudden electrified is that background and the Beatles not saying hey Val this record so let's stay with the I Want to Hold Your Hand back as if they were really expressing you know whatever they felt music almost told me many things I'm one of the biggest Hang-Ups that I ever had trusted me with categorize people they do not categorize people off things on music in a good visit does nothing with his bad there are some things which allows easy but one doesn't necessarily have to cancel. I mean the Monkees who are enormous and good luck and I love their records and we met them and England and the nice guys so you don't categorize them as being as it went when they supposed to drop to the next one was quite loud knocking in the Press which was supposed supposed to start her stay well hell we are the greatest people with my beautiful Beatles everybody and everyone Spina records means nothing to mess with that I think it is very wise if they would come right out and and I'll Express the fact that fine I we don't play again soon as we are just learning to play the instruments we didn't make our own tracks are we learning and like I said was Davy Jones said to me since you know thank goodness they were yelling at much so they didn't have to hear us when their first concert nothing to do Morphine from Salt right the way they handle the one behind the curve done it myself cuz I'm just not did you there are so many things happening coming it's great really one of the reasons I wanted to get back on the air is that there's so much being done being said so many exciting things happening and there are a couple of new group so you are involved with one is cream and the other The Who and I thought perhaps that you tell us a little about them because I know as soon as I mentioned a couple of the groups around it was that without them having a big smash record to hear there was a lot of excitement they at least I had one wreck it out there among the more erudite and crew of for the cream who have heard about that Eric Clapton is in the group and I recognized one of the great guitar players could you tell us a little about these are good people I come in to them by my whole conversation I watch on Chromecast. I didn't really sort of have that much but I'm very proud to be associated with some cream and the hula hoop by everyone including me has been tremendously important and I've had both been doing these Sunday night concert suicidal fishing license in London and has been a tremendous success and The Who and the cream of both told the bills that to very successful audiences I mean bank at houses and they were fantastic unbelievable when was the who that was The Originators of taking the lead guitar player taking the is good time just smash it to Smithereens and the but yes they will they didn't actually do it because I'm trying to give it to you to show how good that way but they did in fact put up such a fantastic the cream for cream work unbelievable are on I think when you have them over here with you like very much I think I can you listen to us all of hope all is going well I hope you come see the well it started like on the March 25th and we're looking forward to having them both are there it is a great deal of activity here that's going to be a lot of press because we want to make him feel right at home because of the fact we've heard so much about them back we're going to play the cream in the pool right now Happy Jack's my guest is Brian Epstein and this is wri fan here are more of the caves nightly little Soiree we hope that you out there in radio land get a an opportunity now to get some place out there was an eight that listens in I hope he smashed but thank you for the most important thing was to create in our minds and in the minds of those listeners know exactly what the story is with regard to happy and as a boys referred in a war and the story with regard to The Beatles breaking up and another rumor again which is really had a chance to see through and to this day if the people still thinking that they are breaking up so that we've really cleared that up and just projecting you yourself is that someone who loves music has some very definitive ideas is there anything that you say as of as a next step for example a show maybe with Lennon and McCartney music or a kind of new type of concert or something that would be that you felt is the next step for them is there anything in your mind now or or is there a visit just enough alone the same things and account register A New Concept but I've no doubt the will be just as how old are the actors are coming together toward making the new film right now and I think they'll be successful but one doesn't to say years and had people ask so you want some new sound going to be want somebody who wants this actually the best thing anybody ever said about that was once when I was watching it comes up in Liverpool she's definitely a fresh I'm listening to a speech and was conducting and then you know he was quite a character and he just turned round to the audience I didn't want him I can't remember what he was talking about Reese told me about great music and put the music the music for lifting something how do you said you were just going to get down to Basics to sort of the music that I really the great Tunes going to have the sounds as well and I think we are developing The Sounds today and the techniques but you're going to have to change it to it's so important I think that as as it has happened in the past or just I want to vent I guess will lead to another I'm trying to get an entirely New Concept of a stage presentation for today's music I know who will soon find out if it works and it's its present form of excited about it I believe in it but I think too that the boys are very young creative in that sense of property when their time comes will make their move in and work a tour or a personal appearances have not been completely ruled out because it might just like recording that taken much longer after in Valatie Myspace to make records today I mean I've been in the studio is now for weeks and I think this is very good and very important because they are meticulous and almost hypocritical of the rain work and I won't let anything from I mean I know something on Penny Lane which wouldn't of made a scrap of difference to its potential anyway the pool rang me up at the very last moment and said that he wanted to make one small alteration and then he made it he got George Martin to how to make it and although it would make any difference it makes Perfection and this is important the this is what I've heard from another thing which they're doing it's happening too many people are saying it is most important things are we please with it you know that we wanted to go out cuz I think at least they have their own self satisfaction and head that way isn't that they really believe that's a good record I think that's probably very important today as parents think there is one thing that some people in the concept of fussing defenses they aren't day I'll terribly good at out the Beatles although they've enjoyed spending since Trump States and all over the world that's success on stage has been exposed to Too Many Factors like in his successes anyway but they don't really I didn't think they have a really sore today will grant that Grace on stage but it was more a projection of Personality became over the made them great on the stage was unable to appreciate some people who are in the concept of Concepts today great performers I mean I can save dreams I who Jimi Hendrix especially for me some of that means a great deal is still a black who is good at being onstage and another another another person and this was why I originally I managed him but aldens mention that I hate because otherwise I wouldn't be managing them very well known here and I have the pleasure to present in London and I think one of the best concert I've ever attended was when 212 hundred people make money in my infanta I presented The Four Tops Converse for me was one of the most exciting on since they are the rain for you could wish Verizon we've had too many times and I chose me because never had a pain if you would like television shows but never where they could do a complete concert but I like. I think this Bears out what you had said earlier it isn't that they made some records and all of a sudden they were going to go ahead and and performed if they made that nightclub around for years I used to travel with Billy eckstine on tour and played all the finest upper-class I don't know if they had Norman with them they did they have their own, putting them into a sample or two shows only that we pack out and it be difficult to get tickets its audience to the fullest extent that was really reach out and before you know what the audience is really participating in father is and they do it he'll is one cuz I've been just on time just been back down. But that first one will be on the road because it was within the confines of this oh that was just too much do I shouldn't I guess times and moments I know I do too and you must let you remember it was very exciting. Zendaya in theater in concert I don't know what the expressionism in England as far as radio was it pretty much the same same limitations or restrictions or attitude as it has been saying the past 23 years I don't know maybe getting my bed bathroom I don't know sound that's a lot of sound is much better because it's much more understanding of what is required but if I'm selling the television has to is the Pirate Radio Station still operating the Pirate Radio station was supposed to be I don't know where it's where it's where it is cuz if there was something about me coming off the end of March I order that fighting away somehow. I don't know what's happening there has been a tremendous amount of bothan find Dylan of course was starving of more recent album Simon Garfunkel and the young lady was 15 years old and write and record of our own Tunes fighting to Janis Ian and I think this attitude of free expression and absolute honesty is that is I think a thing which is not contrived honesty or contrived blatant a statement is is I think the thing that's catching the fancy of our Owens I like to play something for you to hear cuz I need to get a kick out of it this is Janis Ian and it's too much email from her new album is called Jamie's Blues that's my best friend by young lady I think she's that says an awful lot in their album will give you want to take back cuz I think thank you she's got an awful lot to say can only say that we are just delighted to hear Black right from the from your mouth about the Beatles in about the overall attitude as far as where they're going and how they feel about certain things and you yourself how you feel about your continuation lot of people said that you were selling at your agency and there's a big room around here that you were selling out and you were just going to do all kinds of other things in the grass I don't think you could do that Brian did you is there any particular well it was that you're involved with your own theater there and of course the management of the group now you have an organization with Jax's and agency is well right and what about yourself I mean you are on TV your book was successful and is there any other things that you as an individual or yes or messes up things I'm very hello to get involved because I seem to find night should become involved in too many too many things which makes it difficult to concentrate on one thing that's why I hope that with the new management agency operation which we have in London which is quite considerable cuz I can concentrate on the things that's really concern me and I mean one of them just so I got involved and maybe I shouldn't have got involved and I'm going to make some mistakes Seville fan but it won't be a big important thing you think I guess you see that you just if you are creative and want to do things you have to fight you know not to get involved and that the prices are real hang up 411 thank you I really enjoyed the visit I was wondering whether or not there's anything before you do that you could tell us about in England as far as any changes this seems to be again either a different Trend musically over there than here it's been borne out perhaps maybe by the type of exposure that I record like River Deep Mountain High. It was so big and England and just did nothing here and yet we're playing at here that's all if we getting calls and letters and everything about the house for this trial records for you and I know striped records half and half and I have been in England and one doesn't know why they didn't happen and both contact number I had heard and again I didn't know it was just a somebody's statement about rhythm and blues really coming into its own over there now is this something new or is it true or has it always been I think it's true and I think it's always been I've presented a lot of American office Sunday night kitchen light check battery Edwin Starr was a while I didn't have the kids here but well maybe I shouldn't say this but he didn't have the best banking possible but he was almost like a Levi stumps audience people like that like Chuck Berry do I know Eddie is going to fit in my face for a week cuz of the first visited the made to Ingram Road Runners these people will be appreciative I hope did Muddy Waters ever played did the one thing which I hate just from a personal standpoint which I am I'm cognizant of and I think that the Beatles and yourself probably fall into the same boat no matter where after a while to say after the first opportunity that we had when they first came here as we actually went on out on the town in New York so it never happened after that but the First Time in Forever able to go to Miami and take that it a day off and but after that and I became very aware of it as a Time progressed there are certain precious that you put that it's like if I'm in this business now today I'm going to in a radio station where my attitude and and the station itself and the reasons I came back allow me to be myself and I have my life is so very much and I think it has given me so relax me because if I don't really believe in saying something I would doing something if it hurts me as an individual I won't do it like getting the boys to do a promo for someone to say this or someone to say that like it started to get on me so badly that I really became sick and are about it and I've got to a point and I wasn't there a bit of it that no matter what whether it was a special police were there too. The Beatles and keep them away people away and let him get some relax no matter who it is always somebody wanting something from from them over from you it was always getting closer or knowing and put it over it always end up with it would be just an autograph or I have this or I have that there was something that they wanted you to do either for themselves or for somebody and it got to be it must be a very very hard road to find yourself in that position because every time you look around it's somebody asking if I was trying to do anything wrong with trying to keep me away from over and try to allow them to as far as I can live in a contented life switch to a certain extent they do but they are as I am gregarious want to do things but it's a hangout me having to do things was terrific pressures particular when you didn't understand the pressures which is 64th was nothing to match with 64 it was very thrilling Toyota a mistake me I was knocked out but on the other hand you know you come live like that forever so it's it's a it's true I thought that they never did leave me any kind of normal life and you didn't know after while if it became like a political Circle you know certain people try to get in and we're on and they were the officers and propositions which are made to me which is quite ridiculous but it's made by persons with a complete lack of comprehension is it true that you were offered at a million-dollar does a million-dollar tour for a couple of shows I mean I suppose I could look it up in front of my finals just in case you guys are all kinds of all the lake I always remembered it as seeing an ass or just talking it was no interview or anything like that and we were talking for the Paul head said if you promise not to say you can the title that like to play something for him just before I love to hear it played the the album from the score from the picture which I heard it's a sign cuz they can see it people talking about music and Simon says oh boy that was put out the Beatles album and the kids saying probably you know a nephew or summon the Beatles here's your Beatles down with a B that old time music you know and this is what his own his own relationship come in their attitude in here and I'm not worrying about tomorrow that it said they're not looking for Eternal to the map to buy Dukan well maybe it was the the thought thank you but I think the future is going to be very interesting when I for one am looking forward with Keen anticipation with the to get the album and and hear what they're doing and I'm delighted that everything is status quo as far as a relationship and they're being together and you blew up and do something American Press cuttings from our office and I read them in some of the indicator trap country to write back and say you know this is not quite true in fact I told us stronger than that I said that was a load of rubbish and I just want you to know that particular while I'm so the personally hurt but but I just hope that Strawberry Fields and Penny Lane might prove a thing or two and it sucks but I'd like to ask you about like for example Tomorrow Never Knows which is supposedly again I had them saying it Without Really the complete knowledge of the interpretation some of it was based on the Tibetan Book of the Dead is that correct and applied the Tyrannosaurus and marvelous is there any it doesn't really matter what the thing is based on what it's about for analyzing things that people put on record particularly music music more than anything else I mean that music has been analyzed every why I'm buying everybody but it doesn't matter because it still provides somewhere I think I think that you're for analyzing what they had done I say 64 but would they started writing and creating what I call a Latitude music because it had I think one of the great attitude so I did a film on she can work it out on the on the two we can work it out and which was afraid trying to say don't put it in a don't put a label on it cuz you have going to box it in but there's two or three different interpretations of that lyrics and I shied reason why I showed it to him with three screens which gave both at a comedic interpretation light interpretation a very heavy interpretation on a political level and their music I believe this is what basically lyrics are I mean crystals aren't they you put them up there if you want to say it is very personal old lived near Penny Lane know about the barber shop in the bank I'm sorry but this time I mean to say that this isn't going to provide half a few minutes to people all over the place. There is no guessing the right interpretation of the lyric it was supposed to mean I think the idea is that it's if it if it entertained you or you get something out of it fine you can interpret it that way but I think the reason that for example I am more interested today and a lot of people are more interested today and not dissecting but getting a further insight into their expression of what what they are trying to say what they felt when they were doing it what they wanted to express this because that today all over and particular as I said before they were the the four stats that experiment that I have never seen a group that experiment it so much 14-1 record to another and each time that they were saying something about something very well they did it very well but I'm interested because today musicianship writing lyrics are so different and so same so much and that way before a group is a group today you begin to recognize certain instrumentalist because of their great ability to play youth she started to recognize their musicianship and their poor writing ability and it's very interesting for me and I know for the audience to find out in what direction they were pointed pointed in in whether or not it was just a creating a song or creating it from some sort of experience I don't know I do not and I didn't really comment but I suppose that it's creating a song about the time for Backpage me this being a good time for them as well as I Want to Hold Your Hand is just as important well I think there are many Good Times ahead for you and for the Beatles And I want to type thank you so much for taking all this time to spend with us tonight and we trust that will as we vote before before we hear a rumor I like the opportunity I'll call your office and Mainland and they'll tell me first time because the Beetles are very much together and eppie is very much together and we're looking forward to a lot of very very exciting things has he functioned field has been more like a chant and it's been an as pleasurable quote into you I'm close as I've ever had any way thank you very much good night
