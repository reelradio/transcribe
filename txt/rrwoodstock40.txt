people town of Woodstock New York System near 60 miles from what was Max yasgur's Farm side of the festival in spite of the fears of chaos which ran rampant at the time many of the townspeople have good memories of the event was very good for the entire country and we mention that we come from Woodstock let me Paisley the statement that's where the hell the festival and I have to disabuse People by telling them no which type of adults 65 but it was the most peaceful Festival that was ever produced in this country that's what we want to hear keep listening for more Woodstock minute Spotlight on a generation business John Sebastian with another look at Woodstock Ten Years Later what started out as a simple music festival certainly turned into something much bigger at Woodstockwhen fans do you can I take the festival with somebody's dream that got out of the control of the dreamer it just was taken on as a collective Dream by a bunch of people go to a rock and roll concert is not in on it is not intended as a way to change the world you know it was it was a nice idea to have this tremendous concert but they will hold the idea of the logistics of it and so on made for some difficulties and yet people willing to put up with some of the difficulties because it was such a spectacle that the fact of all these people gathered together and Joel rosamunde one of the main architects of the Woodstock festival was quite certain about what he would do differently but I think there's one thing I would change that one reason for that is I feel so good about that project so pleased we've been apart him that the part that we played I'm afraid to change one tiny little bit of it there was some casualties associated with his although not a direct result of the festival and of course he always always would like to do that over and have it come out better but as far as the rest of it was concerned and there's not one little bit I would change up your afraid to ask but I don't know if I feel as good about it now if I did only myself and Artie kornfeld talking about doing a series of shows in the Woodstock area I have done a festival in Miami and when I moved up north we thought it'd be kind of nice to do it. Summer concert series thinking about ways to means the idea of a rose Talbert put something down on paper some ideas different packs at remind me to get out of the country in Africa for the things together that we would need I just went and paid Santana $1,500 for the entire budget for the talent was $130,000 to 120 and 130 thousand figure $15,000 for the headline I asked if we're headlining at the time like they are playing and I think Janice and Crosby Stills and Nash it was their second gig because David had a reputation is Steven did we pay them $10,000 and the Rolling Stones in the Beatles the music industry was just coming of age in this country in terms of that kind of power I known that kind of volume and through the film is through the records and told some of it so well in the film was seen by so many people many of those groups became eligible for that kind of status Joe Cocker such as Santana I mean those became known the top 10 groups in the world at that time I think that within a year after Woodstock you'll crack it was probably go see more than any group in the world. He was getting offers for 50 60,000 all the show which was unheard of and soon after that Santana became capable of commanding those kind of I kind of numbers The Grateful Dead I'm done crying since they do almost there with socks crown on their own and it still didn't you he was Graham Nash I mean for World Wide News Gregory's in myself I've ever taken a first helicopter ride I thought we were being flown in and we're about 20 feet from Landing when do the rotor blade and the pilot slipped a little you know what they have to start it down into the ground and that was the first thing and then we found out of the helicopter landed several feet from somehow high power lines so but flying over so many people in a credible incredible this is our second gig this is the second time we've ever played in front of people man we're scared go to some rock and roll can you tell me the story of worship at the time I thought she may have a transportation problem getting back in the next day she got to do the Dick Cavett Show which was important and it was probably better that she stayed behind in New York she got so enthusiastic about our interpretation of what went down there because of course when when the three of us came back to New York about what happened so people are in 15 whole thing and from the information that we gave her she wrote. Which is really as a haunting to believe that someone could pin the feeling so well could execute the moment so brilliantly and not have been there listen to message turn off the ground in a very funny way to Bob Spitz the author of barefoot in Babylon a book about Woodstock two guys named John Roberts and Joe rosenman who were Boyhood friends were looking for Investments to make they were both very straight-laced ivy league young men in their early twenties and already and Michael on the other hand where we're headed east they decided that John and Joe would put up $500,000 for the retreat in Woodstock where all the groups that there could come and make albums and just hang out there not have to come into the city so while looking over the budget Joe Rosenblum said party what's this thing here about a press party for the retreat and I said oh yeah like we would kick it off the right way and we put it we put up five grand and get some of these groups to perform and you know we can make a day of it we can even charge tickets in and Joe said what we could even find the retreat that way and before long they were talking about a full-scale festival and that is what turned into the Woodstock Music Festival as we all know movie Magic can sometimes be deceiving Arlo Guthrie discovered this when the film Woodstock hit the big screen I know I didn't come into LA but the one on the record the one that you see in the movie is not the coming into La that we did that's the one that they took from another recording somewhere and snuck it on there which is why you never see us playing in Woodstock cuz they couldn't sink it up they always have pictures of people smoking dope or something like that you know it was a shame too because we took the war it's possible recording of some terrible night we did somewhere here in our city and I stuck it on there and I was always our find it then so please shocking please mr. Custer fisticuffs woman walks I don't know if you could I don't know like how many of you can dig how many people there are man like I was rapping to the bus or I can you dig it man is supposed to be here by tonight a lot of free Joe Cocker had already seen crowds gathered together for a concert he arrived at Woodstock as the last stop of a tour of the u.s. no way was he ready for the tribal Gathering that was Woodstock we've been a very hectic and he was the last gig on the tour but it was just a very strange feeling you know do you know this down when you about this cuz we play some pretty big places on Tuesday when we go today was currently I'm going to see to fly over now I come to such a mess of people I mean when you lose know I mean it was and still is a biggie me know cuz of people ask me to reflect on it and it's just chilling out doing something just coming over the edge and see how much people have all those people blue Jose mine the favor was returned when he took the stage for his dramatic rendition of Lennon and McCartney's a Little Help from My Friends did you say it was such as many people as this time to Elijah's about Butch Jones focus is cold With a Little Help from My Friends I will try I just got a q u e giraffe What on YouTube I don't remember I got to get my friends. I want to take them home with him I get all his money how do you spell someday Taylor County Superior Court Francisco soccer who's Bob Spitz the author of barefoot in Babylon a book about Woodstock one psychologist told me that that was the most the day parties that they ever had on the face of us are those kids were so stoned and so calm and peaceful and just into the music and so overwhelmed it was this vast area and no cops and no security no threatening people pushing him around and telling him to behave themselves they were stung by that and because of that there was no that's one of the many reasons why there was no fight with another look at Woodstock Ten Years Later there for three days under what normally would be considered adverse conditions in that there wasn't quite enough food and quite enough of everything you know there was three days it was really no place to sleep I just left right outside at one point in front of the stage two guys got up and started to have a fight with each other and the crowd separated so they cleared a little spaced out so they can do it tomorrow then the crowd began saying don't do that cool out and then the guys pulled out and hugged each other you know everyone right away and hugging each other and saying oh I'm sorry I'm sorry just to fight and the nails please welcome Waterbury Country Joe and the Fish Daphne Lane what's the name Baxter of apportioning show Rock and Soul music talk to you your love is like a rainbow the one thing that solidified everybody regardless of the differences was the war attempt to stop the war stop the world we had to confront the establishment and question everything about them and that brought about social change it was profound at the time and had to be profound in order to stop the war something profound and to happen something important something historically important had to take place and do we are still in the shockwaves of that can you ask Siri what does well come on all you big strong man and as 1 2 3 the game as well as the one the wild trade don't ask me I don't give a damn not come on General Flynn there's something about 300,000 out there I want you to start saying what are we fighting for don't ask me who sing the song called before it's too late be the first one on your block how you going to come home and lay down but I just saw this now many of the performers at Woodstock had a difficult time making their way through the huge crowd the Jefferson airplane's Jack Cassidy remembers that only one inch of space made the difference the first day we're trying to get to the stage which was a hard experience at that point we rented a station wagon wheel I believe it's the track or something to get into the middle of the field and there's cars parked both sides path open for our station wagon with exactly one in less than our stash away we'd mastic salary we went to Yahoo and then we went down about I don't know but good 400 cars on one in less than the worth of our car and we got to the stage and then we were trapped there for 3 days Miki Howard we came to Woodstock thinking that there would be a pretty large cuz you know when you're expecting that there were that many people who are interested in coming that distance for that amount of time is Paul kantner again and so we all of us gained a greater idea of the proportion of our whatever you want to call it so that is Patti Smith calls at the community of rock and roll now that rock and roll is more than music the whole way of thinking of looking at the world different than what went before different values different goals in different ways and between everything we've been taught and that's what rock and roll and that it Woodstock we became aware that it was like there's a lot more of you know there's safety in numbers is a lot more of us than we have thought that way it gives you a good feeling in your heart let's welcome Victor Richie Havens I call it always called it an accident because nobody knew that was going to happen I just came back from Italy and I swear to you I mean there isn't one teenager there who isn't ready to come to America to go to a second with stuff. One and that's the whole entire United States you know all the people that come to me and talk to me I'm talking about still I mean we also got to remember that did a teenager's but just becoming old enough to go to the movies to see it for the first time in 1979 so this is the only one going input really it's that everyone who sees his going to be affected by it because it is what it is and that is probably one of those aces in the hole that particular movie for World Unity probably want to go out aces in the hole and we won't even know I mean every kid in from 1950s left home practically in the sixties I mean just a foundation on voice for those things to come out and see open basically and it it was that simple that the kids who were out there living and not doing the nine Divine survive and not doing what mothers dad told him to do and all of those things that created the atmosphere that you could live the way you want to live you could do what you want to do nobody's looking to tell you that and that's the way it is and that's what that to me for it on that whole $10. You know what everybody else who hadn't been at Woodstock who may not have never hung out with a hippie or whatever dog sitting for Lily and finding oneself and you know I got quiet one of the highlights of the Woodstock festival was the performance of a little-known San Francisco band ab and brought to the festival through field Grand Marshal of the column footing in the band were relatively unknown and never been out of the Bay Area performed at Woodstock. They were very very well and that whole lot of fusion of jazz and rock and blues was received extremely well and I think they probably helped to hasten this success by couple years by a five-minute Woodstock. don't know if you got this call sis. basically Woodstock Raleigh of Journey who was with Santana at Woodstock but in a different form masses of people some of them disasters Altamonte some of them that some of them were good but not that that was the first one and you can't you cannot repeat that it's like you can't wait till I come there's no way I can copy it you can get clothes you can do it but you cannot do it again I'll tell you a story with the author of barefoot in Babylon a book about Woodstock I believe the Grateful Dead and he said if you want the Grateful Dead you're going to have to take another one or two of my ax and they could we don't want another one or two of your axe you know we don't want any of these unknowns there were unknowns the time hope that Grandma is trying to get off the ground they said this Festival is only for the top acts in the country he said I'm sending you have to type. I want you to take one or two of these acts have no way they both not come out and he couldn't make up his mind he flipped the coin he turned down one of the axon that was a group called it's a beautiful day instead took an absolute unknown group called the same time of Blues Band we've done a tall man and then we hadn't done it all we've been through everything the kids been through the mill to get it they fought against the war together they'd heard all this music through enough in it one time they've done every drug that you never known update got embroiled in an every political battle and cause for close to five years running in addition to all the music that was in Woodstock they were bombarded with in five years with the Beatles or stones of who these incredible Innovative artists they had done it all and Woodstock more or less just represented this is it this is the end this is the big party to celebrate the end of the year up to celebrate the end of a ball that first they were second-class citizens where they come into the room and this was the Paris coming out for first we took a hundred feet in every sense 14 cameraman and all kinds of support Crews a lot of film stock a lot of lighting equipment and a game plan in all four of sensible aesthetic coverage on one hand the rain would came crippled us technically one song on the other hand how could you ask for more dramatic sequence come out with all the mud in the calories in an hour or so on the whole I think we we really lucked out and everything worked out the group so we didn't know like Santana was a brand new group week hold of whatever tapes and albums that we could and listen to them beforehand with Santana and I heard soul sacrifice and you just couldn't beat it and then if possible if we haven't seen a group like Santana we went out and caught their act and watched what each individual person did when you got to look at a drummer and see what his thing is and understand what he's doing and understand what the movie is doing so you'll know how to photographing and then how to admitting I mean otherwise you end up with a kind of formula way of photographic mean cutting rock and roll with bears no relationship to what the music still at the Woodstock festival there was some in the audience that were bothered by the rain in the mud and other is it just couldn't care less sitting on the hillside that was slowly moving it under you you know in a in a pile of mud and beer cans and beer bottles and people who are also blowing and moving through the crowd and what's the same way just became part of the experience that became part of everything that we were there was sharing together to set your mind to if you care to be somewhere making the best of whatever situation ring when you can do nothing about it and you can't make it stop raining in the music is on and you want to be there and have a good time when they tend to get your head into it cuz everyone else is Michael Lang was one of the promoters of the Woodstock festival a lot of things didn't run according to plant one of these nap who seems divinely-inspired as it led to one of Woodstock's greatest moments confrontation with Michael Jeffries who is Jimi Hendrix manager Jimi Hendrix to close the show isolated the last act on the program in the show that was scheduled and Sunday night of class ran a little late and searching me 10 and 11 the next morning when Monday morning when most people had left and I think that part of the the thing that provoked it said in that that great Anthem that it did was just coming and seeing it sort of the Desolation at the end if you remember from the film just seen that field if I kind of battle. the debate rages on as to whether the Woodstock Nation exist any longer hears one Veteran's opinion three guys has changed we all work for a living do you know we're not kind of laying back all day and smoking dope but I think enough of it has survived and people that has changed enough people the activists are here in the anti-nuclear movement the activists are still working on for social organizations they're working in the illegal service places so there are still vestiges of that political activism to be seeing so it's not all gone
