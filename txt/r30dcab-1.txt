That would be a nice way to make a living I started at 13 I had my first professional job at 17 and a radio station is a mailroom boy I finally got on the Arizona as an announcer doing weather forecast on an FM Network ended up doing the Polish American our the Italian American our eventually some disc jockey work and the first job I've ever had in television was as a newscaster the house number 1 for the Silhouettes back in 1958 by the way take a listen to this 1958 as I get a job was to follow music maybe he's close to the u.s.a. why are you talkin about whoever heard of this thing called get a job and they are out of your mind who ever thought I'd only because it's about six weeks ahead of every other one we're getting slightly ahead of our story first we got to get Dick Clark to Philadelphia a process which in real life in fact even back in the forties when he was working in Upstate New Dick's rides with so meteoric most people figured his father on the local TV station was one thing I ought to clarify my father didn't own the television station where I first got my job or on the radio station for what that men did was trade his own career to go into the field that he knew his son wanted to go into in the hope that someday you might give him a hand I did get a job eventually in Syracuse when I was going to school and went back to you to go work for his television competitor and he wrote me a letter of introduction to a man in Philadelphia who auditioned me for a job so in the end of fact what my dad did for me is what every father hopes to do for his child as lend a helping hand and it was a big and you are on have they closed that she came Enzo is just too good YouTube your father who won the A's game don't you just look at it anime where is Valrico SD good morning babe don't you look at that Crosby Stills Nash and Young from the summer of 1970 and will be back with a container former another country music is made a large contribution to the development of contemporary music in the late forties and early 50s pop artists like Rosemary Clooney released records on country hits like cold cold heart and jambalaya and then in the late fifties when Elvis broke the mold and hit both the pop and country music took shape the early name tag for it was rockabilly call it what you like it was a forerunner of pure rock and roll and what are the early Legends is the man that they call the killer this man is unique he has been one of the most controversial performers of the last quarter-century he is I think my favorite piano player I could watch him for our and the endless and obviously but I love to watch him because he uses his arms as elbows his feet is fingers going a hundred different directions ladies and gentlemen you can take at one time yeah oh yeah whole lot of Jerry Lee Lewis too far ahead of ourselves will need to go back to 1952 so I could move from the TV station Upstate New York to wfil Radio in Philadelphia and on wfil TV at the time was the show that under Dick Clark's guidance would ultimately become American Bandstand Bob Horn who is the disc jockey in Philadelphia and when they decided to do the television equivalent of His Radio Show he had another partner name least to her they did the show for two or three years together they did not get along as well as they might and Lee Stewart went off the other things Bob continue to do television and I did the Radio Band Stand down the hall and every once in a while they would let me walk in and substitute if he got a cold or was on vacation has touched e Jim Newton when that shot resume magazine just Jews in life one night all right baby, right Bagon battle is not yours a classic number one hit from a man who made his Network debut on American Bandstand and went on to become an international star and a very close friend of Dick Clark's the late Bobby Darin not tell me if Dick Clark call you would you hang up on him either but we'll hear about a man who did when are American Bandstand 30th anniversary celebration return most amazing things about Bandstand is the fact that Dick Clark is hosting it dick like Philadelphia's bands down so much he tried to become a permanent bands down host in Cleveland and almost lost out on the opportunity of a lifetime percent of the audience who were watching television at the time so I made a telephone call to the station manager of a of a local station in Cleveland Ohio and introduced myself and said I'm the fellow that is the occasional substitute on the Bandstand I'd like to come in to Cleveland and do the same thing he was snippy I said terrible things to me and then virtually hung up on me no no no no no no no Philadelphia's own Orleans from 1962 with don't hang up just think if there might not be an American Bandstand today thanks to Dick a lot of visually freaky rock stars have been made palatable to the public will meet some of them a little later on but in the meantime here's dick with the story of one performer whose reputation preceded her this is a lady I'd read a lot about and I have to tell you I was intimidated by what I read because I thought she's going to be a little freaky or crazy and then she is in a way when you look at her perform she is like a female Mick Jagger she's like a wire stuck in the wall and snapping around the studio and it was obvious latest from Pat Benatar Fire and Ice coming up next Sam Cooke and Barry Manilow when our 30th Anniversary salute to American Bandstand continue and we're back with our American Bandstand 30th anniversary celebration celebration very close to the heart of the show's host Dick Clark's in 1956 the Master of Ceremonies of the show lost his job in a dispute with the television station and so they beckoned me up the hall from the radio station and said we're going to make you a television discharged he and therein lies its and quiet nights a week and the show was phenomenally successful I was able to get over the the reticence of some of the audience to accept me and it was going along Billy blue blazes and all of a sudden the ABC announced that they were going to take off the old English films that they've been feeding out on the network and we're going to do new program and I said holy mackerel I'm going to lose my job so with that I ran up to New York with the station manager in Philadelphia with a kinescope in those they didn't have tapes it was a it was a film taken off the video tube and show them these kids dancing to records You Can Dance Play it's going to be here don't forget who's taking you home can't you see I will never never let you go I love you oh so much you can can you take Unisom but don't forget who's taking you home Toto the Last Dance For The Drifters in 1967 during putting the show on the network the ultimate decision rested with a man named Ted Federer and thanks to look and careful strategy dick was able to convince the ABC brass that Bandstand deserve to go National call us we'll call you and I and I ran in Malaysia my youthful enthusiasm or something I'll be a son-of-a-gun they finally got to look at it they looked at the ratings in Philadelphia and decided to give it a short run in August and the rest is history don't know much Joe Bob's Domo what happened to the girl that I don't know much don't know what happened to Noble YouTube Don't Know Much Robo alive spider don't know much about what happened I don't know that from the moment American Bandstand join the ABC television network on April 5th 1957 the country was treated to a never-ending passing parade of new artists and moo music dick remembers one debut in particular I don't think I really knew this man was going to be a star but the minute he sat down at the piano and he sang the song and I saw the reaction of the audience I might have been a moment late but I knew right then he was a star and it was the first time I ever sang on network television on the Bandstand a thing called Mandy weather Eugene number one for Barry Manilow back in 1975 Mandy a rare interview with a true legend of rock and roll when are American Bandstand 30th anniversary celebration one of the most rewarding aspects of bandstands popularity has been the parade of talent to pass through it Studios some flashed across the stage for forgot is the Bandstand itself and some would surely have endured at their lives and careers not been tragically cut short performers like Ritchie Valens Bobby Darin the Big Bopper Jimi Hendrix Jim Morrison and this man whose rise to fame included this vintage appearance on American Bandstand see you again I don't know one of your activities how many songs have you written a few minutes to think back and think of how many they were but I guess all the good it's been about 15 or 20 minutes that many how old are you by 22 it's a lot of writing in a short length of time crazy it is so what is menopause it's so easy Louisiana Buddy Holly and the Crickets on American Bandstand almost three years ago to the day buddy of course lost his life in that tragic plane crash that took the lives of Ritchie Valens and the Big Bopper
