Corner harmonizing is best exemplified by a group of kids from Belmont Avenue in the Bronx on the old Paul Whiteman radio show what was the sort of what are they doing now Dion dimucci is now a born-again Christian a very happy many does the strictly gospel music is very successful he will occasionreplace the old songs but my fondest recollection of him was as a very shy teenager who used to sing with his friends in Subway's and boys rooms where the echo came off the tiles and they created that doo-wop sounds typical New York sounds it was their trademark in the Belmonts it was written about a girl named Dolores you know she was sick I couldn't run it with anything but the lavoris or is another but the Runaround Sue was the good about the rhyme that gave it's true and you and I feel blow you know and that was that we had to Saint Patrick Gordonkeep away from Runaround SueAmazonparmesannumber 14 Dion back in 1961 run around to city street corner and start harmonizing but I don't know the beach in California and there are no street corner so obviously the kind of Harmony developed by Brian Wilson of The Beach Boys was quite different back chronologically the begin with when it all started what what started the Beach Boys well who was the surfer at that time then he came home one day from school and said hey Brian write a song about surfing everybody would love it cuz

continues American Bandstand 30th anniversary celebration of the past 30 years but now is then one Superstar will be conspicuous in his absence is anniversary of American Bandstand television special this year but there was one man the king who never appeared on the Regular Show mainly because I don't think Colonel Tom Parker fancy the idea of his getting paid as scale fee of $155 however we did talk to Elvis Presley when he went into the service with great regularity on the telephone to keep his audience aware of what he was doing and of course to help promote the sale of the records that was Colonel Parker's idea not a bad one at that on the occasion of another Bandstand anniversary in Germany we've had little trouble getting through, we're getting ready for a big intersection you know how many Gold Records you have now in your collection 31 that is a fantastic record there's no getting away from it tomorrow are you my heart was count you my soul no that's you just like a river if we lost true love and sweet evils of sex the one and only incredible Elvis from 1960 and it's now or never know because Dick seen them all on Bandstand during the last three decades that ever be any more Mammoth Superstars like Elvis or The Beatles musicallys going to be awful hard to find another Beatles or Elvis Presley because we've come a long way in 30 years of popular music so that the audience has the divided off into little slivers of special interest as close as we came in recent years was a man who captured a middle-of-the-road listening audience a country audience a rock and roll audience and strangely enough for a man who made his debut on American Bandstand as a teenager became probably the biggest star of the 80s Kenny Rogers in a bar Toledo cross from the people one of ours too she took off for me closer when the drinks finally here surge with living I'm hungry for Last Forever After I'm at whatever the other bring in the very last saw him and I closely watched him please came to the woman sat there beside me he had a strange look on his face the big hands remain calloused but he started shaking his big heart was breaking you picked a fine Time to Leave Me Lucille call Ivan you picked a fine Time to Leave Me Lucille after he left I ordered more whiskey I thought it made him look bring the lights up to the bar room at all the word kept coming back Time After Time you picked a fine Time to Leave Me you pick the news Rogers and Lucille here right after this when our 30th Anniversary salute returns American Bandstand 30th anniversary celebration continues back in 1952 and the last well that's years may be decades away but in between the first and the last there will have been a couple of songs creatively customized then Dick Clark my major contribution to rock and roll in the songwriting was a title I wrote once some fellas brought me a song and it was all about the The Rage of doing the the bop and that was a dance of the day in the late fifties and I said you know that the dance has hit its peak one thing is we are all going to record dances they're called record Hops at the Hop call baby baby number one for Danny & the Juniors back in 1958 At the Hop more involved in the making of records that I am nowadays and I can remember it vividly sitting in the kitchen of the man who ran the record company and they played me this song on the phone from Boston as I recall it was written by his mother and I said you know that it's good but it doesn't have we didn't have hooks in those days but I said it needs something and it became the hook of the song and what I did with beat on the kitchen floor and I should emphasize the bass drum and that became part of it that in the world the most exciting thing that could ever happen to anyone at that time was to be on your show because that show is such a huge monstrous show as it is today it's Freddy Cannon Tallahassee Lassie back in 1959 recalling his first appearance on American Bandstand will be right back with a couple of more singer-songwriters who made a lasting impression on popular music when our 30th anniversary celebration continues we're back with their American Bandstand 30th anniversary celebration time now to contrast the styles of a couple of things in common they were both guests on American Bandstand and they were both poet We Begin that routine idle but he followed in the footsteps of Frankie Avalon and Fabian Rick Nelson and Elvis Presley he was a studious serious Juilliard School musician who broke the moles and became one of the most popular song writers of all day and of course he made his initial debut on the American Bandstand singing this song do you dream how do you make are there when I did oh Carol and I thank the Carol and I got all that Lola male thing we was talking to Carol on the Dick Clark Show O'Carroll is that something you've been very nice and I tell the kids when I see your shows all the shows and things on television I told the kids that you were responsible meals just one of the boys who appeared on American Bandstand Dick Clark remembers another black male female jazz artist country artist rock and rollers people thinks an awful lot of the of the raucous rock and rollers but there was one man who is a poet he was a thinking man's writer in the thinking man's performer I miss him because he he had a very unique style of singing and storytelling Harry Chapin when you coming home you know we'll have a good time you're welcome and the Cat's in the Cradle and the silver spoon it is a hung up the phone coming home, he'll know when the wheels back in 1970 for Cat's in the Cradle and we'll be back with more great music and special surprises including a record and enough dances to keep you
