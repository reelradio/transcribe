although I knew it would be horrible only those who have suffered the loss of a child to know that the pain is infinitely worse than you ever imagined it could be it is simply Indescribable I have a favor to ask on behalf of myself and the rest of John's family please don't call or stop by and try to talk to us about this although we know you all mean well we have all talked about this so much the past week that we simply cannot talk about it anymore for a while we would however sincerely like to thank everyone for the prayers that thoughts and the expressions of sympathy again there is no way with just words that I can adequately express our deep appreciation I would also especially like to thank my wife Judy who remained at home this past week because we had some pressing personal business that simply had to be taken care of immediately and her staying behind the naval me to remain in Idaho for a few more days after the funeral and take care of a zillion things that had to be done in regard to John's death also she was the one who filled it all the phone calls which came to our house one after another from morning until night all week long and took messages for me thanks a lot babe I love you I certainly there was a whole lot more bad news than I ever needed I am happy to report that there also is some good news and then some great news first the good news John's mother is Sister Linda and his brother Tony are fine holding up remarkably well given the circumstances by the way Linda just graduated from college with a degree in business and already has a job which pays actual money that also she got this past week a new car for graduation I had insisted that if they were going to have cars during high school and college that they pay for them themselves and Linda was driving a 1966 Oldsmobile Jetstar which was at least a block-long with a bashed up front end that God and I am not exaggerating on this for Mi to the gallon so with a college degree a new job and a new car she is not ready to go out and conquer the world Tony is 19 just completed his sophomore year in college in previous summer has he had worked as a lowly lifeguard at the pool but this summer he got promoted to to tell assistant manager of the pool and he is on a real Power Trip and because he actually gets to hire and fire people the market news John's mother made it to the hospital emergency room before he died and although most of his organs were too badly damaged to be of any use the hospital did ask her permission to remove the corneas of his eyes and the day of the funeral on Wednesday letter came in the mail for me Idaho High Bank to inform us that the cornea transplants had been completed they weren't successful and today to people who were previously blind and now see so that's neat also the other day his mother I'm going to I'm going to make this related a story to me that I would like to share with you although you really have to know the two individuals involved to know how humorous this is John's two best friends were neighbor Robert and Dave Robert and Dave are brothers and the evening after the funeral they stopped to buy John's house to tell his mother that they had just been up to the cemetery and given John what they termed a 21 Rock salute explaining if it since they had no guns they have gathered 21 rocks from a gravel road that runs by the cemetery and while a blazing sun sinks slowly in the west and the Shadows from the big old trees lengthened they had stood alone in the cemetery over John's grave and fired 21 rocks they do a Clearblue Idaho Sky nice touch so that's the bad news and the good news now here comes the great news next Tuesday would have been John's birthday and I am convinced that it will be the happiest birthday he is ever had because I am convinced that my son is with God for some reason known only to his creator he wasn't here that long but that's okay with me because I'm sure he would much rather be where he is now solve to wrap this up again our most sincere thanks to all of you for your thoughts and your prayers and finally one more thing happy birthday John Steve allergic you know how much I love you and know how much I miss you but it's only temporary so long for a while and I will see you later and tape recording your eyes talking with Rich trying to record this afternoon and one thing I am so glad is that he went to Hawaii with us because I almost didn't let him go because Kennewick have problems in school you know Lynn and Tony they never had problems I got A's and B's I've been trying but John was always a struggle for him and the white thing just happened to coincide with Tony spring break so that was cool and John wanted to go but I was afraid if he missed an entire week of school he just wouldn't be able to to make it up so I told him that he'd have to pass on this one and let you know after I graduated that we go somewhere then I got to think about it after I talked to you on the phone I saw what the hell and I called up his instructor and asked if we could hurt him that much and he said he was doing a good job in the tub you can probably handle it so I phoned him up and told him he was going that he had a good time there and back to on the golf course you have regularly depressed myself rich and Jack because he was hitting five iron shots farther than we were hitting three woods and he doesn't even play that much golf I think the clothes he wanted Crazy Eights Champion that was the highlight of the trip Crazy Eights is a card game that's kind of a stupid card game that's the only card game I know how to play relay in one night we had the Crazy Eights championship of Hawaii there was other eight of us involved in the game and Crazy Eights the more people you have the more time it takes it must have taken us an hour to play one game of Crazy Eights it was for the Hawaiian championships and John with a big smile on his face slap that last card down and won the Hawaiian Crazy Eights Championship so that was kind of need anyway, I thought that the time that the two of you had in awhile I was really quality snorkeling and he'd never seen before and also that was many tortoni so that was a first for both of them so anyway well I'm not going to say anything because there's a really isn't anything to say a lot of meaning to anybody who has children and will go a long way toward helping them if God forbid if you're waiting until some day to do something don't wait cuz maybe that someday incoming you know so do it now has a change to your way of thinking about I'm so might head is so screwed up at the moment I don't know well it's yeah it's changed it's changed a lot of things but right now I'm so in all messed up I really don't know what I'm thinking and besides we got commercials to run here it's 16447 W Washington Chicago with congratulations 2 Michelle Clements Marseilles our latest American dream vacation winner
