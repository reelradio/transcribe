light of my life the true to life story of men and women living there span of years and Vine typical small Midwestern community a picnic in the park in tungsten part in Pine city where the birds are chirping the townsfolk having a wonderful time. It's just certainly delicious that's been sitting out in the hot sun for 7 hours to Howard Pines Junior enjoying some of the food that's been sitting in the sun for 7 hours and Mark to measure the Falls noisily to the ground this perplexed is dr. You broke your hand find a bullet to his friend who certainly Pikachu of your he finds them one by one falling noisily to the ground to have bad breath Google suddenly he was approached by The Newlywed in town near Lisle Brown bowl back Brown molehill elevator guy who goes into the psychiatrist office right blob how nice it is to see you as well bear with the name Edith his bride you want to thank you for the lovely pop-up toaster you gave us for a wedding 70 Wesley Dr Duncan notices blob is growing faint as is the blob himself call noisily to the ground I don't understand this to himself must have bad break why or is everyone at the picnic falling noisily to the ground I was going to stay around and eat some of that good food that's been out in the hot sun for 7 hours but I think instead I must do something about my personal problem obviously there's nothing that the Medical Science World can do for me I must turn to a higher schorsch I must go see a parish priest Father Knows Best Junior and ask him for guidance and so dr. Duncan leaves Thompson Park in Pine City and decides as he heads toward Father Knows Best Juniors man's he will jog and electric electricity runs down tree-lined streets knocks on the door and is greeted by Father Knows Best Junior who earlier himself was at the picnic all this delicious food has been out in the hot sun for 7 hours that I brought back from the picnic to tell him of his concern Parish priest I have a problem you see how are you all right you seem a little plate or something oh my God. I also said My Father Knows Best call Zoe Zoe headed to the car those that's men's I am I to do or what am I to do there's nothing left for me to do but go to the ultimate Authority on breath matter I will go to the airport and buy a ticket and fly to shape Lewis so I can visit the Masters and Johnson breath clinic now he will fly to Saint Louis in order to meet with Masters and Johnson but dr. Duncan has never liked airplane food and so we find him today sitting aboard the airliner as it leaves for st. Louis I hope a nice flight dr. Duncan sitting in the seat and on his lap a basket yes I don't like your plate and food so I brought along some of that delicious food from the thickness that's was I was in the hot tub for $7 it was during the picnic did people first begin began passing out but they talked with dr. Duncan and now carrying some of that delicious food with him aboard the airliner he is greeted by the steward is a stewardess just approached me how do you do man and we have a lovely Airline dinner for you some wilted lettuce with some junk on top of it a cold steak and some Boulevard potatoes nevermind I like my own with this delicious food from the picnic the stewardess in the back yes indeed it is your deviled egg yes it is yes I love those would you mind if I had one for you as usual with the stewardess would ask for the whole bag from the passenger side Dodge the devil a doctor Duncan hands are the devil day she partakes there of noise to the floor how's the airplane good heaven it struck again all I can hardly wait to get to Shea fluish to the Masters and Johnson's breath Clinic dr. Duncan pearly hurrying to get the help that only Masters and Johnson at their breath clinic will be able to provide for now he looks down and sees the still form of the stewardess lying in the aisle at his feet I've done it again I've struck again dr. Duncan convinced that it's his bad breath there's no hope for me that's causing everyone to fall so noisily to the surface on which they stand until this airplane lands in st. Louis that I can finally get some help from the Masters and Johnson Brett clinic or I hope this plane gets there in a hurry. You're Duncan himself has as yet to partake of this food food that he brought with him from the picnic killed in Pine City food that have been in the Sun for 7 hours what seems to be the problem as he is about to enjoy the dog is suddenly interrupted by two strange voices and then he realizes captain of The Airliner and the group has passed out back there maybe she should be up there in front flying this year playing asks dr. Well do you say I like to play this part right here. Right now we don't need to neither one of us need to be there cuz we're on automatic pilot the plane for another 15 minutes then we got to get back there this thing that's why they then then after that time we'll have to begin to land in St Louis Ave there sir the pilot 7 hours are we going to have some of that potato salad if you don't mind but they yummy Megan there so the pilot Biggs in and enjoy it if you don't want one of those two pork sandwiches have the co-pilot is going to have a shelf that was delicious I want to go back now to that was was Walmart easily to the floor airplane my breath must have done it again oh now what am I to do fish airplane has no pilot and co-pilot pilot told him that it was on automatic pilot on would be for 15 minutes a couple of minutes ago on by there must be about 13 more minutes remaining on automatic pilot didn't explain but who dr. Duncan realizes he must keep his head before he can much panic the passenger I certainly would not want to disturb or cause undue alarm among the passengers in the Econo classic section so I'll I'll get it for my sheet here go up in front. Don't worry. Everybody has a right to the bathroom he has been carrying that could be anybody in there out there in the cockpit the flight engineer I'm at the fight engineering job growth of the co-pilot of this year playing in the stewardess by the way I understood his can you fly an airplane in place of flying engineer I can get us where we're going Nifty but I don't fly too good where we going like we're going to shake Lewis do you think you can get this there give it a try I got about 12 minutes before the automatic pilot goes on so I'll I'll have a little lunch how's the Hutchins for shovel. Enjoy the sandwich realizing that I have to take off the automatic has done it again this time weird there he stands in the cockpit of The Airliner now with the flight engineer lying At His Feet he's aware of the back in the account of class section lies on the floor of the pilot and the co-pilot on the stewardess dr. Lowell Millhouse Duncan faced Indy with a very serious situation as the minutes tick away and st. Louis approaches I cannot pay the passengers especially those in the economy class section because heaven knows they have to put up with enough hardship even though I cannot fly an airplane I will get on the intercom system and assure them that I can it'll be alive but it's the only thing I can do for their own personal safety and so dr. Duncan feel good I'll put some of this food is delicious food from the picnic and they can help you show so he looks around there that all the tiles in the knot of the switches flying in this year play my name is Doctor love. the pilot and the co-pilot have all been knocked out by by bad breath what do I do here outside the door he begins to hear does she know which one of these things actually you should mind if she'll get 9 minutes left around the cockpit and trying to figure out how he would go about flying the plane open the door here in the cockpit she would it is 70 realizes no 152 passengers are unconscious my breath must be so bad it went over the intercom system the entire plane load of people now why unconscious right outside the cockpit door and dr. Duncan concludes that he must somehow safely land the plane in St Louis so that he can quickly get to the Masters and Johnson's breath Clinic before it's too late or perhaps it already is quite as your truck complicated-looking piece of Machinery is he looks about the cockpit he sees her that excited to be off in four and a half minutes Isles and knobs and switches on the radio and they can give instructions to me over the air on how to spell goes down to the radio dial use trying to find Saint Louis where they are on the diet and stop there that radio signal from Pine City at be Mitchell building their number one disc jockey that would be nice I enjoy the Doobie Brothers and I still have three minutes and 45 seconds left before the automatic pilot goes out. It's kind of Charlotte I won't be able to hear the Doobie Brothers because you say automatic pilot goes off in 3 minutes and 45 seconds and then you must what's doctor by the plane once the automatic pilot goes off Indy doctor Duncan will have to take control of the plane himself and so he continues trying to contact the st. Louis airport tower I wonder if that's the shape Louis airport hello this is Doctor Lowell Duckett speaking how are you at the st. Louis airport thank goodness now perhaps he can get and I need some instructions from the airport what do I do well first of all you have nothing to worry about until the automatic pilot goes off when it goes off because it makes a funny noise apparently I now have something to worry about if that's the funny sound the automatic pilot makes when it goes off doctor Duncan now is in complete charge of flying the airplane you're going to have to give me instructions there from St Louis on how to fly this thing all right, see how would we start a boy take the thing you see in front of you and Class B permit all right is she what you doing for directly in front of me time does grasps no no it's just a pilot date book was your mother's numbers in Cleveland put down that they play grab the wheel is the outer crust one side at all times no good Heavens know what is the outside of a dump and looks around through all the tiles than model I would with the altimeter number on it it's good number Persian and let you have for their in this reported to the power the number for oh wait a minute hold on that's not the altimeter that's the Fire Marshal's seating capacity for the cockpit oh yes use the altimeter I'm plenty High all right now the thing to do if course is to find out how he will go about Landing this airliner at the st. Louis airport Luis I have never been to shake bluish before although I must go there now to visit the Masters and Johnson's breath Clinic that's the reason of course that even got on this airplane to st. Louis because he is convinced that his bad breath is caused everyone in his presents to pass out how do you save a spot for the area just look for the big arch Arch all right I'm ready for Lending and strain so no doctor Duncan must concentrate easy listening do all right listen to The Man in the tower is turn on for no smoking side which I know because of course I'm here in the cockpit steps over all of the people lying there on the floor thanks for his bad breath returns to the cockpit and reports it says no fumar is that all right call that's apparently the no smoking sign is burned out before you can land well obviously vitally important is that you turning on of the sign that says no smoking or no fumar before landing a giant airliner also is you've heard all those in the passenger compartment Li unconscious dr. Lowell Mill House Duncan finds himself at the controls of a giant jet airliner approaching St Louis all right now I smoking citing poor are English-speaking friends he is being inspected by the tower in St Louis as to what he must do to prepare his Airship for landing just before you be sure and tell the passengers to finish their booze return their seats to an upright position all right I'll do that then what do I do just before I left just before you land be sure to tell the people at 76 degrees in St Louis and you hope they'll fly your aunt Eliza get Landon are play many things to do the reason. I wish I wish I wish I were back in Pine City I wonder if what my dear friends are doing my dear friend is the Hoosiers I wonder what they are doing right now strangely enough at this very moment in mr. and mrs. Heuser & Heuser House of antiques have just sat down to watch Eyewitness News how much more of this do we have to watch their tasks is there a fairly it's been on for 2 hours we only have an hour and a half and I will be all over missiles Heiser but I'll be quiet Christine is about ready to give us a news story oh you certainly are cut up Jerry now here's some more fun news and airplane is in trouble over st. Louis all passenger save one or unconscious the plane is being landed by a local resident doctor who'll know how stuck in the vine City my darling you have turn Ashton what is the matter my age I'm just your voice notices that Mrs Heuser has turned white as a sheet upon hearing the news about dr. Duncan having to fly and land there playing it's just that I've flown with low before he has a deathly fear of Landing he always faints just before landing holy cow a new complication just before landing is a passenger dr. Duncan always faints and now being responsible for landing the airplane as its pilot obviously should he thinks it'll be curtains for Dr Duncan know what do I do how do I reduce the airspeed are your flaps touch the runway something with your engines and makes sound and scares the hell out of everybody all right I'm ready I'm getting 300 Hazel Grove think I'm going to pass out wait a minute I'm a doctor I I know I'm suffering from this year of Landing I also know about the people who pass out there must be something I can do I know what I can do mashing up in this way the blood rushes from your head in order to counteract that I will make the blood rush toward My Head by sitting on my head down on the seat there in the cockpit in front of the controls sits on his head put on the brakes and stop that big son of a gun while he sits on his head where is your recall when airplanes start to land then I'll keep the blood from draining from his head absolute concentration there I go to land this big son of a gun so now with total quiet absolute quiet in the convent after dunking concentrate put on the brakes well here I am I have landed right by the arch in st. Louis which is the home of the Masters and Johnson's birth clinic I'm sure if anyone can cure me they're the ones to do it and so dr. Duncan Thousand Oaks the cockpit of the airplane walks of the air over the unconscious passengers the pilot to copilot and Navigator and the stewardesses all whom he feels passed out because there is bad breath usually are lighter and they have their guns drawn and tells dr. Duncan to spread them as Fred Fletcher a private Clinic landed the plane successfully by McDonald's and I don't have a Big Mac and an order of fries to go
