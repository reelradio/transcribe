Tony Bennett we get a lot of call for here is the world real turntable trouble I'm at this one plus this is the kind of situation you have a nightmare on the turntables are completely dead nothing work this is where chief engineer artsmiths comes in like the Cavalry to the rescue he's anxious to telephone hold on I got a number no no busy mean that's busy too fine now what this reminds me of a b they didn't the Mad Magazine a couple years ago you've met with Eddie Lawrence is old philosopher this was kind of an old philosopher for a run Line 1 you say all your turntables quit working has gone to the beach for the day you just got to add live until he comes back during up I'm at the landsraad or maybe operator 113 but her lines busy too that's why I'll what you have very little choice in the situation like this and sit back and light up a cigarette this line is there's something and apparently interrupted some of them power in some of the circuits and got the telephone well that's great no music no nothing I can't get hold of the engineers and what to talk about back of the University Professor used to have us describe things for exercises W Katie's a large Green Building I guess about a half to three-quarters of a city block in size Square during the daytime broadcast city is teeming with activity during the night time right now absolutely no one here but me it's a little crazy at times you let your imagination run wild this is some good night to do it right now I'm sitting in the main control room it's elevated about three feet higher than the left large main studio with your studio and it's completely dark can't even see you in when you're in a house that's light it up and it's dark outside anyone else I didn't see you you can see out and to my right is Lee Phillips Newsroom it's also pitch-black and separating me from these two Studios a large soundproof picture windows is a big 5000 watt transmitter you things have a fantastic amount of power flashing Rod by the way because all the equipment responsible for playing music is the side of the telephones out of order hoping our engineer will hear me and rush to my rescue as they do in the movies help I of myself and all the announcer said in the middle of this large room surrounded by turntables and a Halloween trick-or-treat machines because the control panel is high in front of me and I have to stand up to speed on the raft of the door can you hear me all the dials check out of check out I am still on the air this is the weirdest thing I think I've ever had happened to me in radio like the like the machines of Chosen One so far they're winning by getting telephone completely dead now swell this isn't the weirdest thing wow so you're somebody coming now it's about time I mean this mic switch for second I'll check okay I guess I won't come to my switch seems to show current running through it hurt to stay open if there's a noise again I heard I heard this song again I can have the mic open this time and check I'll be right back can see anybody over here nobody over Newsroom strange kind of interesting study and free imagination running through my mind I wasn't sure who was sort of like me he was doing it all night shift though it you've been doing is Regular Show Halloween but at least his machine for working for him because he barred the door from the inside and he was good cuz it wasn't he was trying to jump crash but when the police were finally able to break in they found the door still barred and then I'll answer was crushed to death by a rack of record albums and falling on him from behind Felicia real cashier horrified Terror on his face papers made a big play of the two no one could get in the studio and those ragged rocks were torn off the waters and find some fantastic strength but he was very dead no one will likely ever know how it happened play Strange what's what's that noise is running overtime colon no I don't feel it as much as I sensitive kind of getting chills imagination I don't know but then there are a lot of strange noises in a big empty building like this this is the kind of situation I was telling you about friends where you don't want to look behind you so help me though I don't mean to be carti but I can I did see something in the other Studio a little flash for rent I can't see anything in there though if this is someone's idea of a joke I don't think it's too funny little red glowing lights all across the main Studio window and almost dies which side they're all looking there's nothing else just those eyes pressed up against the window on either side of me well I've had enough going right out that door and see what this is all about who's there just open and close by itself someone's here I can I can feel it so help me I can't see it but I can feel it someone something in the controller what's that those glowing eyes are getting brighter like little coals from fire something moved behind me know I won't block you never look behind you now that the whole rooms full of that red glow from those eyes I don't pull that off the wall
