Forget you spend the day at the Metropolitan District commission Quabbin Reservoir and belted in Massachusetts and you'll find over nineteen Thousand Acres of angling and one of the world's largest man-made Reservoir as well worth the trip that is a lot of angling isn't that right lady Janet Payne of Champaign Illinois and I don't know if you're familiar with the Mobius ring or not what is an idea I got the idea that a piece of paper has only one side and on the other side and the way this was proved and you can try this for yourself I've got one in front of me right now I did it while I call you take a piece of paper about 2 ft by Maybe not maybe cut the edge off of a newspaper or something and about 1 inch wide to make a strip out of this thing and then you take a piece of Scotch tape and tape the two ends together so that it's before you tape it together it take one twist in another way to put the thing out flat but the strip of paper outside and take one side and turn it over you know so it's got one twisting it and then you take the two edges together and make a little extra little Mark with a pencil on one side of the paper right now. All I can do is to take the paper between your thumb and your forefinger and you hold your thumb on top by the exit you've made and you just pull a paper through your thumb and forefinger like you don't know where this guy papers you find out that the exes on the other side of the paper which is fantastic bit because if you pull it through again if I had the ex is back on top I have a mathematician figured that the only ones tonight so if you wrote your income tax on both sides of the The Forum there next year the government's going to send you a blank will send you a real bullet and lots of luck Boston town crier keeps you in touch with the time they do the YMCA's primary campaign of the Children's Music Theater will present a musical comedy version of the Grimm fairytale Rumpelstiltskin on May 8th at 7:30 p.m. on May 9th at 2:30 p.m. the Highland Club Raven hold their first annual Cabaret in advance on May 8th of the Hibernian Hall in Roxbury the Worcester chapter of the Armenian Church Youth Organization of America will be the man who came to dinner on May 8th to 10th at 8:15 p.m. at the Armenian Church of our Saviour 87 Southbridge Street in Worcester tickets available at the door I remember a couple of weeks in advance of town crier WBZ radio Boston 34 we will has been free of charge hey ladies been away with rooftop singers and I like, play Ladies Choice by the rooftop singers wesp experiment once again if you would be so kind as to do it with me figure out the title and artist of the record that I have in my hand the first person who can do it the first person to come up with the correct title and artist when's the record of sending the record I'm giving no clues all I'm doing is concentrating very very hard on the record right now you have to do is try to leave your mind a complete blank as close to a blank as you can possibly get it I'm not even send me a postcard or a letter or something and let me know what you think might be the title and artist of the record and I'll send it out to you if the one if yours is the postcard or a letter that I get with the earliest postmarked with the correct title and artist I'm not putting you on about this I'm very serious about to ESPN I believe in it and I even if you don't believe in it because we tried several ESP experiments and several times after I've made the announcement of the correct answer or whatever the thing was reading say Mike this is exactly what I had in my mind but I don't believe it I didn't want to write you know any money.
