music on the best station WABC New York if 901 on WABC August 15th good evening I'm George Michael in the following is a brief but sincere tribute to the king of rock and roll Elvis Presley Presley the king of rock and roll that at the age of 42 he died this afternoon Elvis Presley on August 16th 1977 of the following statement was issued this afternoon by Memphis Baptist Memorial Hospital concerning the death of Elvis Elvis Presley was found unconscious at his home by his Road manager Joe Esposito at approximately 2:30 today Mr Esposito indicated that he could not find mr. Presley breathing nor could he detect a heartbeat he began emergency efforts to try to bring him back we call the fire department to the ambulances came the Memphis fire department ambulance continued various activities to try to bring him back especially on the way to the hospital and Fortune there was no heartbeat mr. Presley arrived at the hospital sometime shortly after 3 p.m. the hospital emergency team began working with him and continue their efforts until approximately 3:30 time at which time they decided to discontinue at first it was announced at that time that Elvis Presley had died possibly have a heart attack possible cause of death we cannot be known for sure until a post-mortem examination is completed so tonight we take do you want to talk to look back over the incredible career of the man who ever since 1954 really rule rock and roll mostly UPS there were a few Downs Elvis Aaron Presley born January 8th 1935 died August 16th 1977 at along the way there was a lot of great music for those of you who saw him in concert you will immediately recognize the theme from 2001 also sprach zarathustra the producers decided probably Colonel Tom Parker best represented Elvis someone that was not really of this world he never really lived in this world as we know it at least not after his first million-selling record but certainly the start of the fame and the fortune which came his way caused him to become one of those paranoid people in modern entertainment for example wherever and whenever he appeared on stage he was extremely nervous he would put himself in his music down and I thought that maybe that might be a good starting point was very first record that's alright Mama go back with Blue Moon of Kentucky the first known recordings although he had recorded others for Sun Records were things that rock and roll while they weren't really ready for because it was a country and western song one of the country and western songs which Elvis himself like so much is one that he did do onstage he appeared quite often only wants to go in New York and that was a Madison Square Garden when he did it on stage he immediately let you know what he thought of himself and of his early music what's a terrible guitar can I shake your leg nugget are in another shaky leg so my five songs before anybody knew who we were went like this Elvis Presley live in concert doing Mystery Train one of those very first songs with Sun Records had it recorded with so many people that it really went on to Greatness and rock and roll that they were short-lived Jerry Lee Lewis of course Charlie Rich the great Carl Perkins Johnny Cash there were others tremendous influence has and what made Elvis Presley the way he was in the beginning but one of the people and perhaps the person that I know best in New York who knows probably as much about Elvis has anyone in as a true historian is Peter Midori that your father Peter Maggiore was from st. Stephen's pericia he has a show on Sunday morning of words and uses the theme song of words by Elvis a I thought that tonight would be interesting to have you join us because I know that there are literally thousands of people in New York so you know if you were I make a mistake they will be quick to tell us but there's thousands of people who are trivia experts on Elvis but I know that you are one of the most dedicated cheer people in your research of him in 1953 Named Sam Phillips was running has very small company in Memphis I could find a white man who had the Negro sound and the Negro field I can make a billion dollars and actually he did record some soul music some of the early Bobby Bland you sold them to large companies in Chicago and he never got the royalties from them or the credit for them and then all the sudden in walk Elvis Presley I don't think the Sun Records sound ever has been duplicated you can hear it on on mystery train and his first song That's Alright Mama can even hear it on some of the early Johnny Cash records like the ways of a woman in love had kind of a bouncing Rolling Along sound too and I think it's something to do with the studio with recording kind of a hybrid of hillbilly and rhythm and blues it seems that came because of the teenager he like to listen to the black radio stations among his favorite singers with Billy eckstine b.b. King live in spots that's alright Mama was from the pain of a little-known black artist named Arthur crudup hey what's up man work mostly in the forties and Elvis might have a great deal actually in the late 60s he financed an album for mr. credit the other big musical influence on Elvis also has its roots in Black America and that's gospel music his family belongs to a fundamentalist church group in the side from blacklite bigotry in the South that hymns of the white Bible Belt congregation very very little from those the black churches the music was moving and it moved and actually that's famous pelvis routine was a natural outgrowth of those hand clapping and swaying gospel singer house in January of 1956 one record change the entire world of music Elvis Presley in the record that changed the world it was in 1956 January actually that record along with I was the one which was the flipside got all the play but people said he's only a flash-in-the-pan he won't last Carl Perkins was also recording for Saint Phillip's and Sun Records at the time had recorded a record which was in the process of becoming a hit all across America but mostly country and western well they decided that Elvis Presley to do the record that it would sell Across America and it was this record although Heartbreak Hotel was his first million-seller this is the one that said ladies and gentleman Elvis Presley is here to stay Pokemon Elvis Presley taking the Carl Perkins Blue Suede Shoes he made it a million selling a kind of said everybody Elvis was here his next record was to be the biggest record ever recorded was the most difficult record ever recorded was also to be his favorite we'll get to that in a second also an early interview done in 1956 with Elvis Peter you know today rock music is very serious business studios are equipped with sensitive complex equipment in the engineer who runs the mixer is an artist in his own right most of the time but it wasn't that way back in 1956 even the big companies like RCA Victor had rather primitive recording facilities and by the time that Elvis was under contract to RCA Victor record anything Nashville Studios they brought him in for a session on January 4th of 56 and he was going to do the numbers with his old son, was Bill black and Scotty Moore DJ Fontana plus Chet Atkins and a gospel group called The Jordanaires the building had a back stairwell which gave out a kind of bizarre sound Echo if you left the studio door open as well not a very professional recording technique but that's the fastening Hollow sound what you hear on some of his biggest hits including Heartbreak Hotel and Blue Suede Shoes I want you I need you I love you how did he get a chance to go into that recording studio well this was asked in 1956 before he was known really as a superstar that he was to become about some of the things that he did because he had to answer questions early because later on in life he would not Grant interviews as you probably will know the first question put to him after one of his hillbilly shows Elvis how did you get the break with Sun Records and there's a guy that took down my name told me my call me sometime so he called me about a year-and-a-half later and I want and I made my first record that's right Mama Elvis also appeared on the show called Louisiana hayride I was kind of a Saturday night Grand Ole Opry was big in the south of fact I'm sure round London well remembers it and all this was asked how he got his start on that radio show I went I went down once and I went back again a couple weeks later and and the paper lately they seem kind of go for my songs little bit so they they gave me a job down there that's how all this got started as far as the Louisiana hayride closing words and thoughts Elvis Presley was a man who really found the words hard to express his gratitude and the surprise at this man from Tupelo Mississippi was becoming a star and I can't tell you how much I appreciate you and all the wonderful people that have been right man and buy my records and coming up soon because I asked her to what makes anybody's is a people you make him a break them probably the most record recording because it took almost 57 takes according to Bill Black the man who was that have several hits on his own perhaps the biggest record of all time when we put this makes know for sure Elvis Presley Elvis Presley died this afternoon in Memphis Tennessee born January 8th 1930 5 Tupelo Mississippi Jesse Gordon his twin brother died at Birth his mother was Grace and of course that's from which the name Graceland comes where Elvis called Home in Tennessee is Father Vernon was often times photographed and staying with them Elvis really replaced I believe in most would agree with us James Dean he was the ultimate sex symbol of the mid-fifties with Rebel Without a Cause and East of Eden movies like that there was no one like James Dean Elvis did replace him he was a truck driver the First Assembly Church of God was a church which he was assigned the country songs are mentioned Louisiana hayride R&B artists were his favorites at 8:13 they moved in Memphis and that's where I grew up he grew up very poor influence b.b. King Bobby Blue Bland people like that but don't be cruel song was probably the one that more than any other he really enjoyed it and it took so long we said Bill black and what not but prior to this people really only knew I was proud of the movies people only knew all this by way of Television he first appeared on television with the door to Dorsey Brothers it was a television special replacement summer special and no one is ever seen it in like it before and no one knew really quite what to make of it and strange it was January of 1956 when he did his first television show after that he appeared with Milton Berle Steve Allen and find a Sullivan at first at Sullivan didn't want to have a moment he had been asked of that day or two after the parents of the other shows would you ever have Elvis Presley on your show saying that he's drawing the ratings away from you is it not on your life and at the very time he was saying that publicly he was negotiating for the appearances that's kind of how I remember Elvis Presley first my very first recollection I was in grammar school and I went to a cousin's home because I had this record I have to play for you and put on the turntable I couldn't understand a word of it the Southern drawl was so sick the song called Old Shep all I knew was that it was very sad and end really got me where I lived I began to listen to the radio to see if I could either strange man again next thing I knew he was on The Ed Sullivan Show and I I sat in the living room watch that was neat great at the time and I remember them blocking off the bottom half of his body on the screen the next day I went into school and we talked about it to the 8th grade sister and the nun was just terribly shocked that anybody in her Catholic school could like this person but that was the beginning of it for me that's what really turned me on to Elvis Presley that's enough point on I followed his career great deal Father Peter Midori is worth of the Studio C on George Michael the king of rock and roll has died Elvis Presley dead at the age of 40 to television have been the main source of people knowing about Elvis once he appeared on The Dorsey Brothers show there was no doubt that his career was going to Skyrocket Colonel Tom Parker quickly hustled him out to Hollywood California and then he made his first movie do you remember the movie Love Me Tender he then released his first ballot at least as far as most Americans to love me sweet Love Me Tender title tune from the movie which starred people like Richard Egan Deborah pageant it was a movie that really gave a totally different impression of Elvis the most people have seen before first of all the release of ballot and how to become a million some people weren't sure what to make of it was in the summertime of 1957 but several other of his great have came out things like All Shook Up which we opened up with tonight that was his first big American tour and wherever he went he packed I mean it was like beatlemania and then some there's nothing I hate anything quite like it before it was in 1957 that I had the pleasure to talk with all this for a while in St Louis Missouri to chase Hotel it was the first time I met him and posing as a high school reporter I managed to pull that one off and you learn immediately about the man that he never really believed his own success he never believed that all this was really happening to him and you can't help but wonder how it was they might not believe in some of his own success one of which was based on a book entitled the stone for Danny Fisher that was King Creole or perhaps the most talked-about movie of Elvis was one that people still enjoy when it comes on the light show today was summertime a 1957 Mickey Shaughnessy and friends with Elvis play Jailhouse Rock at 9:28 on WABC New York on George Michael good evening the king of rock and roll Tide this afternoon in Memphis Tennessee Elvis Presley dead at the age of 42 and what is tonight in the studio is Father Pete Amador who hosts the Sunday Morning Show of words with y'all this course has me the title song from the movie is there were many there were things like loving you for the highlight of the two really King Creole along with Jailhouse Rock thoughts regarding movies I'll tell you George most of his movies really were Dreadful if you catch them all afternoon show The Late Show The Late Show you can see that they seemed more like script to put together as a bunch of songs used he could sing and is really an attempt to tell a story Jailhouse Rock was a fairly decent script and King Creole as you mentioned was a rather sophisticated and racing awful but at times don't add any fish it and then he did a cliff at a desk script which was called wild in the country and had no big songs in it I remember flaming Star as a sort of uplifting Western what you tried to Champion the what is the Indian and portray the difficulty of a mixed-breed person of any racial origin things like that but after that they kind of sunk into a formula that's very reminiscent of Bing Crosby Bob Hope sort of thing that it is this one good thing about him though that is that if you're a superstar you can record the material you want to and inside Movie package get a chance to experiment with material that you couldn't risk releasing as a single since I remember from King Creole very interesting song called crawfish which was very New Orleans Blues orientated and then you try to German folk song a thing as a couple of centuries old, wooden heart in one of his other movies which another artist Joe doll by the way they made a million Southern the summer time in 1961 so the record wasn't all that bad I Know It with interest but there were a couple of movies we said that stand out in your mind as you talk about those middle years of Elvis when everything was going right for him and 57 the Jailhouse Rock it was really nothing major happen until the summer of 58 and in 1958 before we get to that event father was a day survived by his mother Grayson at course he named Graceland after an everything you always heard was about Elvis his mother Grace this has to have been the most that maybe one of the most traumatic experiences in his life some of the hens has recorded reflect his missing his mother was really just feeling about his mother especially things like if we never meet again this side of Heaven that I'll meet you on that beautiful Shore I'm going to walk those clothes and stairs things like that he's probably thinking about meeting his mother in heaven and 1958 America cried at least those who were the followers and worshippers of the man who always had teddy bears and Cadillacs with Elvis Presley without sideburns very quietly more politely than probably any other man before him stood and talked to reporters as he prepared to sail for Germany as a US Soldier are there any questions momentum everything was straight down the middle I was treated no better or any worse than any of the other boys. That's the way I wanted it because I have to live with the other boys you know what the boys picked her up at all kind of expected and KP and marching with a pack on my back and everything with me so I could well be just like we are so I got along very well with them and now I did much more than the ideal girl I'm also a rock and roll the popularity of rock and roll of diminution anyway while you're in the Army and that's hard to tell out the only I can say is I hope nothing is it a relief to get away from all the autograph hounds and the historical nothing else but once you get used to it if nobody comes up and ask for an autograph or if no one bothers you I've been just got worried maybe I'll be up there like that you've been very lucky or do you feel that you do have a talent of the most of the other people you meet don't have I've been very lucky I've been very lucky I happened to come along at a time in the music business when there was no Trend they were looking for something different and I was lucky I came along just in time for the library of the USS rental and we are now only minutes away from sailing time and Elvis Presley will shortly be on his way to Germany and a return to the United States who knows maybe sometime anyway since this is probably the last chance that you'll have to say something to your fans do you have any particular message that you'd like to pass on to them I yes I would like to say that in spite of the fact that I am going away and then I'll be out of their eyes for some time I hope so I'm not out of their minds I'll be looking forward to the time when I can come back and entertaining again like I did and Elvis Presley Are You Lonesome Tonight We actually took that out of chronological order only because it seemed to be the song that's so many people really hold very dear to them was a song that I thought just kind of seemed to fit the way you said I hope that I will be able to come back from the Army and entertain people will pick it up with when he came back out of the Army in just a second it's 25 minutes before 10 on George Michael on WABC Elvis Presley dead at the age of 40 to the king of rock and roll little doubt about that spot a pyramid or any other thoughts about Elvis as far as movies and especially about life in the Army maybe I remember thinking when he went into the army he'll show a fact you did at the time that I was just beginning High School most authority figures especially clergyman and teachers and Educators very much down on Elvis Presley because I felt that he was a bad influence on teenagers they thought that he stood for work elements in the society in for that which was Unbecoming and ungentlemanly and he's even in his own mind to play the whole thing straight Candice and he had been offered a tour of Duty in the entertainment unit he said no I'll do this my way I'll do it as a regular Soldier and I'll show everybody that no matter what anybody says about me I can serve my country and do my duty and do my job and he left that impression with everyone doing the two years so that when he came back out again he was really very much an establishment figure someone that young people could look up to some of the people didn't have to be afraid of anymore the only thing that really changed about Elvis when he came back out of the army was The Sideburns were gone The Sideburns worthy trademark of Elvis first record recorded once he went into the studio there been various disputes and arguments probably always will be but the one that he decided to release as his first American release when he came out of the army early 1960s Elvis Presley said I've been in the Army but I'm back home and I'm stuck on you and always will be the king of rock world with Elvis Presley was back out of the army that he was King good evening on George Michael the king of rock and roll Elvis the one-hour tribute to the king who died this afternoon this just in from Memphis Tennessee the medical examiner in Memphis just moments ago said in her attic heartbeat caused the death of Elvis Presley dr. Jerry Francisco met with reporters moments ago after an autopsy at Baptist Hospital Elvis was found face-down on the floor boys bathroom at Graceland Mansion the 2:30 this afternoon by his Road manager Joe Esposito doctor Francisco says it is likely that Elvis died earlier perhaps as early as 9:00 this morning the precise cause of death was listed as cardiac arrhythmia is described as a severely irregular heartbeat dr. Francisco added that the cause be erratic heartbeat is undetermined the Memphis medical examiner has virtually ruled out any drug as a contributing factor saying there was no evidence of any drug usage repeating Elvis Presley dead as a result of an erratic heartbeat if you're stuck on you and the success of the records there was in the question could he go out and make a movie that everybody would Tennessee Elvis decided or at least he'll Wallace and friends were in charge of making his movies decided to take him to a more music like plush setting where could you go then to Hawaii in Hawaii recorded Blue Hawaii the song that everybody felt was possibly one of the best movie rather than everybody thought was one of his best and in that chain the song Can't Help Falling in Love in 71 We Can't Help Falling in Love With You Elvis Presley the movie of Blue Hawaii actually was released in November of 1961 Can't Help Falling in Love and for all of early 1962 it was a song that had all this on top actually 1962 from that foot moment I would Return to Sender in a few other Mi hit right on through until nineteen sixty-seven we're not the great use of Elvis I was at a course a series of movies which we talked about Las Vegas May 1st 1967 the wedding to his wife Priscilla and Liv singing of Love Me Tender on the guitar to her at breakfast that morning had to be perhaps may be the highlight of his career as far as he was concerned a happiness finally he found someone who we could share it all with and very sad that he stayed married so short a Time George but I think that's why talk about getting back into his best parts of his career I remember seeing him at Madison Square Garden which was his only New York City appearance he also appeared at Nassau Coliseum a couple of times I didn't know when I bought the tickets that I was the first time there's going to be a New York I remember being impressed with several things about his stage presence one was that he was able to look back at his young self and killed himself it's sing a medley of his old hits and heat makes Sly remarks about them and change the words little bit he also had a tremendous sense of presence that he could project feeling into large crowd of people despite the fact that someone could hardly even see him from where he was I think he carry that kind of performance with him until really until today Elvis Presley the first time we had the Good Fortune to see him on stage was in 1957 when you made that first American to her at that time he was very serious about himself at least he didn't put them self down as he seemed to do as the years went on because the more he appeared onstage the more I'm very nervous with that all of that somehow seemed to take a change it was a change of direction that occurred in 1969 when Elvis Presley for the first time to the best of my knowledge in his career went around and contacted a series of disc jockeys who threw his manager he found have been playing his records through what he called the lean years I hadn't of been with Fortune recipient of one of these invitations where I was himself said I would like to have you come out and not because you play my records but just because you've been a friend of mine would you come out to Las Vegas I want to show you that I'm Still The King well it was an honor and they were many of us who went there are many people that he has to come to the Las Vegas Hilton in 1969 he had with him at that time to Sweet Inspirations and I want to tell you this group of gals was really working out they had had several hits their own this was a new change for all this no longer was he with a strictly country and western sounding Jordanaires one of the Sweet Inspirations was good enough to be with us on the phone talking with Ann Williams Hyannis George Michael if you don't know how important the record appear to be the Elvis when I was out there and how much is the satisfaction of gave and how great you girls were the Sweet Inspirations behind what's your feeling was behind it was a great time you know I like doing the whole time we work with Elvis it was like a fun show it all I don't like we enjoyed every moment of it and I think the audience felt that we were really into what we were doing and if that was a child that we were really enjoying that it got to know it all. There is gas today it was a hi hello thank you for coming and goodbye did that change and it was far as people like the Sweet Inspirations of people to back them up like the time that that I work with alvic I became very close to him we used to talk together you know what do awesome today was a very warm very beautiful person I'm going back to the Hilton in Vegas in 1969 was and you correct me if I'm wrong I thought was probably to his most important live performances because he was trying to show people that say I am still the king of rock and roll why did he come by and he said and it's because I want to know that I'm still okay you know and that was the reason for coming by I just hit the new record just came out I'll let you know when I hope you like it it's called Suspicious Minds and the comeback performance on Elvis Presley live at the Hilton Hotel Las Vegas before it was some kind of time in 1969 it was the number one song for Elvis it was a song that really reestablish Jim is once again the king of rock and roll they were great photos of he and Priscilla the happiness they enjoyed it that time the end of course came this afternoon along with it some of the songs we left behind course the the songs that really kind of depicted the unhappiness going my separate going our separate ways from 1972 and then there's 1975 pieces of my love and pieces of my life songs are kind of said that things were not right but all that really will not be remembered what will remember will be all the great years the glory years the years that made Elvis Presley the king on WABC on George Michael and Father Peter Midori is with us in the Studio's we said tonight and we asked father if he put together with with all this being a very religious man it would be a negligence on our part not to include maybe a prayer for Elvis in the Bible you have called the guy creator of all the wonders in our world sound & rhythm dancing celebration hear our prayer for Elvis Presley his family Miss many fans like every other man he had his failings the harsh glare of the Limelight made them public for you who read the secrets of our hearts and understand the stress he's under which people live remember instead the happiness you brought to so many of his brothers and sisters your children the generosity he displayed to so many worthy causes and the powerful use he made of the talents you gave him all our creative energies Proclaim The Wonder of You by Elvis no with you now what he prayed for so often in the song may there be peace in the valley for him amen January 8th 1935 August 16th 19 77 there has never been any man in the music world who had such an impact on all of us perhaps the greatest song of all the try to close it when our tribute to Elvis with came and December of 1960 from a TV special it was a song the only religious song ever to become number one for all of us that night before millions of people on TV he said I know there is a God and someday I'm going to see you Sunday he said If I Can Dream I know that I can live Let It Be Lord somewhere the best music on the best station WABC New York
